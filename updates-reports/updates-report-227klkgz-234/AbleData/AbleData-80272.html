The set focuses on such concepts as receptive language, expressive language, matching identical items, and sorting. These cards can also be used to teach advanced concepts such as adjectives, function, and storytelling. Each 350-card set includes photographic picture cards in six categories (animals, foods, vehicles, clothing, furniture, and toys), color cards, shape cards, 83 familiar object cards, a storage box, and custom stickers and dividers for organization. Also included are fifteen Basic Stage sets: Stage One presents sets of two identical images on white backgrounds for matching and identification; Stage Two presents five similar items in their natural settings. The back of each card presents an easy-to-use system for tracking the student&#x27;s progress. The cards are finished with durable high-gloss varnish. DIMENSIONS: Each card is 3.5 x 5 inches.
