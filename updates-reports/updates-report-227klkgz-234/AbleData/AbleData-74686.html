It enables the user to convert non-connected handwritten text into a computer text file, such as a Word document or standard text document. The system may be used by anyone wishing to transfer handwritten material or notes to a computer text file without having to retype it. It is simple to use and requires no prior training. The user first scans the handwritten document with the aid of a standard scanner. This OCR program then processes the document, converting it into electronic format. The translated text appears automatically on screen, beneath the original document. The user then edits errors or unrecognized text. The corrected document can be saved as a text or MS Word file. This OCR program can recognize almost any handwriting, as long as the characters are not connected to each other. The program requires only a brief learning period to learn and remember a new user&#x27;s handwriting. It also learns each user&#x27;s vocabulary as well to aid in recognition. Users can define abbreviations so they can be automatically translated by the program. For example, defining &quot;ex&quot; as &quot;example&quot; enables the user to write using shorthand writing, with confidence that the system will recognize the abbreviation and translate it correctly. When handwritten documents include sketches and diagrams, the program can insert the diagrams into the correct area in the computer document. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: This program works with any TWAIN-compatible scanner that can create gray or color images.
