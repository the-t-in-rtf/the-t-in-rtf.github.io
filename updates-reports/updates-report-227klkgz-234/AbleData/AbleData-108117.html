It also prints grade reports and report cards. It can also automatically create a semester or yearly lesson plan, customized for individual students. Diagnostic tests are provided to identify potential gaps in the learning process and fill them in. The program is aligned to state standards to ensure that student progress is reflected on state achievment or assesment tests.
