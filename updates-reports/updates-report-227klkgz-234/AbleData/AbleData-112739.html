In this program, between two and ten paint tubes are lined up on the right side of the screen. To the left of the paint tubes is a simple picture which contains a few sections that can be colored in. A pointer points to one of these sections. The student must select one of the paint tubes for coloring in the section that the arrow is pointing to by either step scanning, timed scanning, or clicking on the paint tube with the mouse or pressing the paint tube with a touch screen. After the section is colored, the pointer will automatically move to the next section to color. Scanning software is built into the program. The program comes with more than 60 simple pictures and includes categories such as animals, food, holidays, and color matching pictures. There are also instrcutions for adding pictures. Other features include: A choice of either auditory narration of colors or lively music in the background; timed scanning, step scanning with one or two switches, or seleting a paint tube with the mouse; selecting a field of between two and ten paint tubes; the ability to change the pointer to either an arrow, paint brush, or colored cones; the ability to set the animation speed; the ability to enable or disable the print feature; the ability to create different picture lists for different users; and the ability to change the narration to another language. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows Vista/XP/2000/NT/ME/98SE, 233 megaHertz (mHz) or faster processor, 32 megabytes (MB) RAM, 130 MB hard disk space, a sound card, and a
                                VGA monitor or better.
