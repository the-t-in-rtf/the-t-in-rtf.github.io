The software program uses a combination of teaching activities and games to help students master the TouchCounting method of touching coins in a specific location a specified number of times to determine value. As students complete each step and play its corresponding game, they learn to successfully count any combination of coins. Once students show their mastery of counting by 1&#x27;s and skip-counting by 5&#x27;s in the first activity, they move on to identifying coins and their values and then learning to TouchCount coins. Activities 2-5 are each followed by a game that reinforces the knowledge students have gained. Game titles include Money Tic Tac Dough, Money Match, Coin Concentration, and TouchPoint Bingo. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple Macintosh or IBM-compatible computers.
