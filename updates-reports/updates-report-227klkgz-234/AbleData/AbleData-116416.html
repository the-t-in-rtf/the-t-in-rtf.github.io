This application (or app) combines the concept of video modeling with written words and auditory cues to help individuals acquire relevant words, phrases and sentences. VAST Autism&#x27;s mirror feature promotes oral motor sequencing and self-monitoring. Using a mirror while practicing speech sounds can provide visual feedback to help individuals improve their muscle coordination and sequencing for speech production, and visual input can be an important source of feedback in developmental apraxia of speech. The user can focus on how to produce the target sounds or words from a video model and then observe and monitor their own attempts by using a mirror. The app&#x27;s videos are organized into a hierarchy of 5 categories beginning with syllables and ending with sentences. Each video gives a spoken target utterance that is preceded by the written word(s). Each word, phrase and sentence is concrete and has meaning that can be generalized and practiced throughout the day. This app is available in English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.1.3 or later.
