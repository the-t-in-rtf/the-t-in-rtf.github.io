This application (or app) enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as a voice output electronic book (e-book) reader for books in the standard DAISY format. From within the app, the user can browse, search, download, and read books directly from Bookshare (Bookshare membership required), as well as read DAISY books from other sources. When Read2Go audio is on, Read2Go will read words on the screen with synchronized text-to-speech. With both Read2Go audio on and VoiceOver on, this app will read with Acapela voices and navigate with VoiceOver gestures. By turning Read2Go audio off but leaving VoiceOver on, Read2Go will read with Apple VoiceOver gestures and voice, or it both audio options are turned off, it will display the text with a range of choices of font size, font color and background. Read2Go also can show text on a separate Braille display (not included) connected via Bluetooth. The user can save books onto the Read2Go bookshelf, adjust font size up to 70 points, adjust the speed of the text-to-speech audio, view a Table of Contents with a single tap or VoiceOver gesture, and set bookmarks. Other features include support for all six levels of DAISY navigation built in to the structure of the book, DAISY 3.0 and 2.02 support, support for using iTunes to transfer of non-Bookshare DAISY books to the user&#x27;s device, and support for &quot;Open In Read2Go&quot; for access to books from the Bookshare website. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
