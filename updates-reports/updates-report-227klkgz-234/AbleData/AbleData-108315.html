                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Armadillo Army is an educational game program and visual training activity designed for use by children who are blind or have low vision. This educational maze game helps students who are visually impaired practice necessary skills such as lateral eye movements, vertical eye movements, searching skills, timing skills, visual discrimination skills, peripheral detection skills, eccentric viewing skills, and eye-hand coordination. The arcade-style game has bright, large graphics for players with low vision, along with meaningful and directive sound elements that give blind players the opportunity to practice listening and discrimination skills. The game takes place in a maze, where Tex, a humanoid with a ten-gallon hat, gains points by gathering up cactus jelly, jewels, and jalapeno peppers while keeping away from blue armadillos which roll at random throughout the maze. When Tex gets enough points, he accumulates power with which he can send out a zapping ray from his finger to zap armadillos and make them disappear. As the player reaches higher levels of difficulty, he/she must also avoid a Texas tornado which threatens to gather up all the goodies as well as Tex. If Tex gets through all nine levels, he wins. The game can be played by a single player or two players. The game program is available on CD-ROM (model D-03400-00) or through electronic distribution (model D-03400-ED). COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP or later operating system; 500 MegaHertz (MH) processor; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM (random access memory); Internet Explorer 5.01 or later; sound card and speakers; CD-ROM drive 14 MB of hard disk space.
