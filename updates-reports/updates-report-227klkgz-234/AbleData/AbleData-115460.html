This application (or app) allows a person to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch as a task organizer and scheduler. The user can create tasks associated with a picture, text, video or audio or any combination of these media to create multi-feature tasks. The user receives an alert (visual and auditory display) when a task is scheduled to be performed. The user can swipe to delete a task after completing it, and then the next task moves to the top of his/her &quot;To do&quot; list. The app will keep reminding the user at various times of the day if a task is left undone. Picture Scheduler automatically backs up created tasks for later reuse and unread tasks are marked and show badge icons. The user can also import video files from the device or via iTunes file sharing. Other features include the ability to show fullscreen pictures; a &quot;Hide&quot; mode on screen; task sorting into categories; and local notifications which show alerts even if the app is closed. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
