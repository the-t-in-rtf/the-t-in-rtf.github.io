                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Clicker 6 is a voice output word processor program and on-screen keyboard program designed for individuals at all ability levels, including students with learning disabilities or cognitive disabilities. It has a wide range of accessibility options for users who cannot use a mouse or keyboard, including individuals with upper extremity disabilities or spinal cord injury. In this program, users can create a customized on-screen keyboard grid with letters, whole words, or pictures. Users can click on these words or pictures to send the corresponding word to a document in the word processor. For example, clicking on the picture of a cat in the grid causes the word &quot;cat&quot; to be entered as text. Users can also type text into the word processor using the keyboard. Text is read in a clear voice by letter, by word, or by sentence as it is entered. The program has all standard word processor features. Documents are saved in .html format, making them ready for use on a web page. When users click on a word or picture in the grid with the right-hand mouse button (on the Mac, Ctrl-click), the word is spoken aloud. The program also works with a touch screen (not included) or with a switch for users who are unable to use a keyboard or a mouse. With the program&#x27;s accessability options installed, the grid can be made to scan. When the desired cell is highlighted, the user presses the switch, which activates the cell just like a mouse click. The program can be operated with one or two switches and with a variety of scans and timing. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or Apple Mac computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM compatible computers, Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or Vista operating system; Pentium II 400 or greater processor; 128 MB RAM; 400 MB free disk space. For Mac computers, Mac OS X 10.3 or above operating system;
                                Power PC or Intel processor; 128 MB RAM; 400 MB free disk space. OPTIONS: Animations library CD to enable users to add animated pictures to the grid.
