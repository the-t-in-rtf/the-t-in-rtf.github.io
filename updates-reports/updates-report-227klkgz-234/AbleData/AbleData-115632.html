This application (or app) allows a parent or therapist to use their Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to facilitate oral motor skills development in children with specific speech impairments such as apraxia of speech, Down syndrome or craniofacial anomalies. These skills are needed for basic functions such as eating and speaking. The app comes with 15 oral motor exercises, auditory information and animations. The exercises include: puckering lips, making an &quot;o&quot; with the mouth, sending a kiss, moving tongue to sides, puffing cheeks, touching cheeks using the tongue, and moving the tongue up and down. An animated duck provides auditory and visual cues for practicing these exercises. The parent or therapist can also adjust the number of repetitions per movement as needed. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2.1 or later.
