The OrCam consists of a small camera that can be attached to any standard pair of eyeglasses or sunglasses, a small but powerful computer that can be clipped to a belt or put into a pocket, and a bone conductive earpiece. The camera is connected to the computer with a cord. To hear a description of an object, such as a traffic light, the user points at the object, and the OrCam will interpret the image in the camera indicated by the user and speak a description of the object in the earpiece. Similarly, the user can point to text, and the OrCam will read the text beginning at the point indicated by the user. The OrCam can also be used to announce money denominations. The OrCam can be taught to recognize objects. The user can wave at a known object, and the OrCam will prompt the user to speak the object&#x27;s name or description, which will be stored and used to describe that object in the future when the user points at it. The OrCam also can &quot;learn&quot; to recognize faces using the same technique. The OrCam&#x27;s bone conduction earpiece does not block outside sound and provides sound clarity in a noisy environment. The device is best used in normal light or daylight, but it can function in darker environments with the aid of a flashlight.
