This alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system is a Windows 7 tablet computer that is preloaded with Endeavor Talker Software (see separate entry), allowing the user to communicate with others by touching graphical buttons on the tablet&#x27;s screen to speak words or compose sentences. The device features over 1000 pre-built buttons for common words and phrases, templates in the button library, and two Cepstral voices. Drag-and-drop page layouts can be configured to have as few as one large communication button or as many as 50 buttons on a page. The user can create personalized page layouts with buttons and images from the included SymbolStix image library, create new Talker buttons by dragging images directly from Google Images or from his or her own image library, and change the color or any page or add any wallpaper to the page background. The user can also record his or her own words or phrases to be spoken using digitized speech, or use text-to-speech to generate speech. Voice speed is adjustable, and buttons can be set to speak immediately when touched or after the user has composed a phrase or sentence. The user’s communication patterns can be analyzed with CSV file logging of all button presses. OPTION: Endeavor Talker SmartLife Service.
