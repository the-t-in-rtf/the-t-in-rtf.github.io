It is for use with an Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. The application (or app) uses animation and repetition to promote literacy. Every page has the same sentence structure and asks the user to fill in a missing word. The app reinforces understanding of nouns, verbs and prepositions. It can be personalized for each child by adding their own photo. The app’s academic objectives include: using words to describe location and actions; distinguishing parts of speech (such as nouns, verbs, prepositions); matching voice with print (one-to-one correspondence); and recognizing sentence structure. Developmental objectives include - increasing phonological awareness; expanding vocabulary; recognizing that print words have meaning; improving visual tracking; teaching multiple options for communication such as sign language, pictures, written words and spoken voice; and teaching a multisensory approach to reading that involves listening, watching and touching. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 2.2.1 or later.
