Allows users to use iPad for basic communication (wants, needs, emotions, etc.) without having to physically touch the iPad touchscreen. The program works by installing Say Hi! AAC on iPad and creating pages with groups of words or phrase boxes. A page can contain up to nine boxes and a box can have any combination of words, phrases, pictures, or recorded sounds. It’s completely customizable to suit users specific needs or situation.
                                Then, install Say Hi! AAC on two additional iPod Touch or iPhone devices. One device acts as the “mover” allowing the user to move between boxes. The other device functions as the “selector” allowing the user to select the desired box and “say” the associated word or phrase.
                                Launch Say Hi! AAC on  iPad and as long as all three devices — the iPad, the mover, and the selector — are on the same wireless network, Say Hi! AAC will pair them by prompting you to select which device will act as the “mover” and “selector”, allowing for communication between the devices.
