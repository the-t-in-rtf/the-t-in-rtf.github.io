This courseware package is designed to be used with the SAL Speech Assisted Learning System (see separate entry). SAL helps students with minimal reading skills read these books from cover-to-cover. Some pages show pictures; users can press on the word &quot;picture&quot; to hear the picture described. The series gives students practice decoding words. Three of the books focus on short vowels and three focus on long vowels. Titles include The Tug, SOS1, in which Gus&#x27;s tug is lost in the fog but reaches the dock safely with a little help from Bob&#x27;s friend; The Red Cap, SOS2, in which Max, a big Labrador retriever, saves Ted and his red cap from a robbery; Up the Hill, SOS3, in which Kim and Pat race to the top of the hill, where a &quot;fortunate&quot; mishap helps Pat race back down; Bass Lake, SOS4, in which Grace and Sue awaken when a forest fire threatens the life of their friend; The Deep Sea, SOS5, in which Dave and Bill&#x27;s boat sinks and they are left adrift until they make it to Gull Rock; and The Red Gem Mine, SOS6, in which Jake and his mule turn out to be good miners. In addition to barcoded braille pages, each set of SAL courseware includes print copies of the braille pages and one SAL disk. OPTIONS: Each book is available in contracted and uncontracted braille versions.
