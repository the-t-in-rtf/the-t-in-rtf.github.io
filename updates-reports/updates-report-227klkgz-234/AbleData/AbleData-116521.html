                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Picture the Sentence HD Lite is a voice output language and vocabulary tutorial program designed for use by language therapists and parents working with children who have cognitive, communication, developmental, or learning disabilities or autism. This application (or app) allows a therapist or parent to use an Apple iPad to help children to practice language and auditory processing tasks at the basic sentence level. The app comes with three different levels of difficulty so the child can learn how to attend to important elements of a sentence and picture the sentence&#x27;s meaning: easy (slow with visual support staying on the screen), intermediate (faster rate with pauses and visual support flashing briefly on the screen), and advanced (no pausing or visual support). This Lite version has a limit of three users and targets the subject + verb + object syntax structure. The full version of Picture the Sentence HD (see separate entry) can have unlimited users and targets additional sentence structures. The user can choose from two sets of subjects: pronouns (he/she/they) and nouns (boy/girl/children). Other features include a sandtimer that delays the presentation of the picture choices so there is a greater challenge to the child&#x27;s working memory; on/off settings for text; choice of color drawing icons or stick figures; and a progress/data tracker that allows the user to collect and save data, and email or print it. There is also a &quot;Pick-a-Door&quot; game that can be selected at varying intervals so the user can take a break; the user opens a series of doors until an animal comes out and says, &quot;You found me!&quot; COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later.
