This spelling aid supplements the spell checkers in programs such as Microsoft Word. It has a comprehensive dictionary of 350,000 words, and can be set for specific levels of difficulty or areas of interest. For example, an inexperienced writer could reduce the number of suggestions produced by choosing the Junior dictionary, while a doctor could narrow the range of suggestions by choosing the Medical dictionary. To help users select the correct word, thesaurus-type alternatives are provided, as are examples of the word used in context, in a meaningful sentence. The program has a direct link to recent versions of Microsoft Word (97 or later) and Dragon NaturallySpeaking (version 5 or later), allowing users of those program to find the correct spelling with the spelling utility program and transfer the results back with a single keystroke, replacing the original. The utility can also scan Microsoft Word documents for spelling errors and homophones (which are highlighted as such). The checking mechanism provides suggestions based on phonetic similarity to entered word(s), so the correct word can be produced from even complex misspellings. Searches can also be conducted on the beginning or the end of words, according to user preference. For those with dyslexia and similar disabilities, the correct spelling can also be supplied when a word with a vowel-consonant pair is misspelled with a consonant (i.e., &quot;elephant&quot; is spelled &quot;lephant&quot;). This program also uses voice synthesis technology from Nuance to allow selected text to be read alod as it appears on screen. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 75 megahertz (Mhz) Pentium processor (166 MHz Pentium recommended); 32 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM) (64 MB recommended); Windows 98 (second edition)/Me/NT4/2000/XP operating system; 100 MB hard disk space; CD-ROM drive; 16-bit sound card; USB audio headset or equivalent.
