Due to its portability, it may be suitable for field-trip activities. The unit is housed in high-impact plastic case and employs a digital voice technology for high-quality, natural voice output. The touchpanel is divided into a 3 x 3 matrix for a total of 9 selection areas on a single level. Each selection area offers 6.5 seconds of digitized speech. A tricolor LED lamp provides feedback during programming. There is no on/off switch; the unit goes into a low power mode when inactive. Under normal usage, the unit should last three to seven days on a single charge. Message memory is non-volatile and will endure even if the batteries are discharged. An overlay holder ring for securing paper overlays (not included) is provided for attachment to the membrane touchpanel. POWER: Built-in NiCAD (nickel cadmium) and a battery charger supplied for overnight charging. OPTIONS: Replacement battery and charger, manuals, pillow speaker. WEIGHT: 2 pounds, 11 ounces. WARRANTY: One year.
