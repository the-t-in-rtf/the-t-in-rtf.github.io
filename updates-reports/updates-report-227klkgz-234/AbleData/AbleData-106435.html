This app can be installed on a range of compatible internet connected devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The NGT Lite works together with the home, office, or mobile phone and provides a text connection in parallel with the phone call users make through the NGT Service. This parallel connection uses the internet through the broadband, Wi-Fi, or office network to send and receive the text part of the conversation while the phone call is used for voice communications.
                                NGT Lite users can either make direct text-to-text calls with others who have the app or a textphone, or use a text relay assistant to communicate with those who do not have the app. The text relay assistant will be connected automatically to relay the call and type down the other person’s message, which will be displayed on the NGT Lite screen.
                                With NGT Lite, users can link a TextNumber, which looks like a standard phone number, to their home, work or mobile number. When someone dials the TextNumber, the call will automatically be connected through the NGT service. As a result, people with hearing or speech impairments no longer have to tell callers to use the 18002 prefix to phone them, or carry any specialized equipment to make calls while away from their homes and offices.
