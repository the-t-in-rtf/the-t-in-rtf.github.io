This application (or app) allows a child to use an Apple iPad to practice listening and reading comprehension skills with a teacher, parent, or independently. StoryPals comes with 24 original stories ranging in readability levels 2 to 6 with colorful, interactive artwork and imaginative characters. These stories can be read independently, aloud with professional narrations, or aloud using Acapela text-to-speech with word highlighting. Each story is accompanied by an illustration with voiceover and sound effect interactions to entertain and to convey the meaning of the story. Each story is followed by a 10 multiple-choice WH question (who, what, where, when, why) quiz to assess the child’s story comprehension. The app allows the user to create his or her own stories or edit built-in stories. The user can also create his or her own quizzes to accompany created stories. The user can select his or her own photos or the included illustrations to complement the story. Included illustration elements include backgrounds, people, animal, objects and animations. Created stories can be shared with others via iTunes file sharing or an email attachment. Individual student’s scores are automatically saved and tracked in the app, and they can be exported to clipboard and email. Group score is calculated with automatic group scoring utility. Stories can also be configured in terms of text size (small, medium, large or extra large) and justification, animations, text-to-speech, word highlighting, pronunciations, readability levels, quizzes (number of answer choices and types of questions), and backup/restore from backup for each student. Additional free stories are available on the developer’s website. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
