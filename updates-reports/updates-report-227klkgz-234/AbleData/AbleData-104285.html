The unit plugs into a computer&#x27;s USB port, and the software opens without needing to be installed. Since no administrator privileges are necessary to install the software, restrictions on public computers against granting installation rights are not a obstacle to using MagWin USB. In addition, the user can borrow a friend&#x27;s laptop or use a family member&#x27;s computer without installing undesired software. The module can be attached to a keychain and carried in a person&#x27;s pocket or purse. The screen magnification program has magnification levels ranging from 1.5x up to 36x. The magnification can be increased in increments of 0.5x. The program has eight different viewing modes, from full screen to a single line zoom. Dozens of color combinations are available to decrease eye fatigue. Character outlines are smoothed as they are magnified. While the user is zoomed into a portion of the original screen, the Focus Tracking feature highlights messages, warnings, and other information the user may need to know. The cursor is auto-tracked so it is not lost off the screen. The mouse pointer&#x27;s color and size can be customized, and the cursor location can be marked with a cross hair or circle. A Zoom scroll bar tells the user what part of the screen is being viewed no matter how large the magnification. As a screen reader, the program reads any text to which the user points with the mouse. It also repeats whatever is typed, either by letter, word, or line, and it reads information in message boxes, tool tips, and other pop-ups. The user can choose between two voices and adjust the volume and speed of the screen reader. Other features include hot keys and auto-start on start-up. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Windows compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8 (32- or 64-bit); at least one USB port.
