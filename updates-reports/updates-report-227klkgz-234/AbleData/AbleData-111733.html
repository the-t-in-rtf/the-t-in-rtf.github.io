This software provides voice output for the standard functions on a multi-user desktop telephone or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) pffice telephone system, and enables the user to control telephone functions through a computer keyboard or alternative input device. Its internal text-to-speech (TTS) capability provides voice output for caller ID and telephone status indicators, including which line is being monitored, how many calls are active, how many and which calls are on hold, whether any voice mail messages are waiting to be checked, and whether the program is currently forwarding calls to another number. The text-to-speech capabilities are customizable, allowing the user to select from multiple voices or alter the speech rate. The user can also disable the program&#x27;s built-in TTS in favor of a third-party screen reader. The program allows the user to perform telephone functions using a mouse or keyboard, including placing and receiving calls, placing calls on hold, parking calls for retrieval from another phone or by another party, transfering or redirecting calls, conference calling, call forwarding, immediate divert (iDivert) to Voice Mail, call logging, and voice mail access. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers (PCs) running Windows. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or XP Pro with Service Pack 2; Intel Pentium 3 or faster processor; 512 megabytes (MB) RAM; 50 MB of available hard-disk space; sound card and speakers or a headset with a microphone; an extension in Cisco Call Manager 4.x with attached desk phone or soft phone; and Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) Service Provider installed and configured on the user&#x27;s machine.
