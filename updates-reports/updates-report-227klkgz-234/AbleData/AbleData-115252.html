The program comes with a library of more than 11,500 words using SigningAvatar characters. The user types in sentences, phrases, words and even the alphabet and the program will play back Signed English on the screen. Everything the user enters will be saved in the “History” folder for easy retrieval; the folder can be deleted. The user can also locate his or her entries by date or alphabetically. Sign 4 Me’s controls allow the user to speed up or slow down the signing; turn on or off the looping feature; and send the character to his “Home” or default position. This program provides sign language instruction using simulated three-dimensional (3D) animated characters, and these 3D characters can be zoomed in or out and rotated to give the user the best vantage point for every sign and the ability to control the placement of the characters. 3D controls include the following: Zoom in (spread 2 fingers across screen); Zoom out (bring 2 fingers back together); Rotate (swipe with 1 finger); and Pan (use 2 fingers to grab and move character).  Two dimensional controls include Delete all (use trashcan in “History” to delete all entries) and Delete 1 line (swipe across line and touch &quot;Delete&quot; button when it appears). COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
