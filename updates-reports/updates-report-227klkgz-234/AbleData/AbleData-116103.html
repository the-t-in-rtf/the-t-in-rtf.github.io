The Skoog is a cube mounted on a square base with colored half spheres extending from all four sides and the top of the cube.  The user can squeeze, press, roll, twist or wobble it to generate a sound. The Skoog connects to a computer via a USB cable (included), and it produces sound through the computer utilizing the Skoogmusic software, which included with the Skoog on a CD-ROM.  The software can be used to control the sound generated by the Skoog, and it included color-coded tunes that display on a computer screen to guide the user to touch a programmed sequence of areas on the Skoog to generate a melody.  The software offers a range of instruments including brass, woodwind, percussion and strings. The sensitivity of the Skoog can be adjusted, and save individual user settings. The Skoogmusic software allows for customization the Skoog to suit the needs of a wide range of children, and adjustable skill settings offer the opportunity for users to continue to be challenged as they improve their skills.  A user guide is included. COLOR: The entire exterior is soft and squeezable, and the cube and base are white (a black version is available) while each of the half spheres are colored – blue, green, red, yellow and orange. COMPATABILITY: For use with Apple Macintosh or IBM PC or compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (for Skoogmusic software): Windows XP (SP3) or later or Mac OS X 10.4 or later with at least 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM; color display; CD-ROM drive; USB port; Internet access for software updates; stereo headphone/audio out (good quality speakers are recommended).
