This keyboard driven program reads what the user types letter by letter or word by word.

It speaks all Windows menus and dialog boxes, and works with the Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Windows Calculator, Messenger, antivirus programs, and any accessible software program running on the user&#x27;s computer. The voice can be changed, the speed can be increased or decreased, and items can be repeated. With the included WebbIE web browser, this software reads pages on the Internet from accessible web sites. The software comes with two high quality Realspeak voices, and is designed to work with Dragon NaturallySpeaking voice input software (not included; see entry) by speaking the user&#x27;s Dragon commands and input. It is available in UK and US versions with British or American male and female Realspeak voices. The software package includes both a CD and a USB memory stick, and comes with technical support. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP Home, XP Professional, or Vista operating system; speakers; and 180 megabytes (MB) hard disk space. For each added Realspeak voice, approximately 80 additional MB is required.
