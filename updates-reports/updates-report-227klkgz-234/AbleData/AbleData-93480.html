Users make selections by looking at keys displayed on the screen for a fraction of a second (eye gaze). A small camera mounted under the Eyegaze screen takes 60 pictures per second of the user’s eye. Those images are analyzed by a processor that interprets where the user is looking. Users generate speech by using an on screen keyboard or pre-programmed phrases. Various options permit the user to turn on lights and appliance, operate a universal remote controller for television, DVD, and stereo control, and access email and the Internet. The Edge can also be used as a keyboard and mouse interface to any personal computer (PC) or Macintosh computer to run any desired program. Nothing is attached to the user, and the system comes with a flexible mount that enables people to use it from any position: seated at a table, reclined, or lying on their side. The Basic Eyegaaze Edge includes a separate 5-pound processor, 15-inch screen, camera and mount, and desktop mounting arm. Software includes speech synthesis, keyboards, Teach, Phrases, scanning keyboard, and a two-stroke keyboard. Also included is the Eyegaze Settings program which enables a caregiver to customize the phrases and modify the Edge&#x27;s parameters to accommodate a wide variety of eye-related issues including drooping eyelids and irregularly-shaped pupils. OPTIONS: Computer Access program, Lights and Appliances program, The Grid2 (IR controls, Internet, email, text messaging, play music, Skype, calculator and more), Speaking Dynamically Pro and Boardmaker (for children), and EyeMouse program for on-screen control of off-the-shelf software. On-site installation, three hours of training, and one year of telephone support. DIMENSIONS: The processor is 6.5 x 6.5 x 2 inches and the monitor is 15 inches. WARRANTY: One year.
