This full-screen talking email program operates in a sequential manner, where it asks one question at a time, such as &quot;Who would you like to send this to?&quot; or &quot;If you&#x27;d like to speak your message, you can do that here.&quot; The email partner (sender or recipient) does not require any special software to interact with the user of this program. The program also enables the user to send or receive mail from other users on their system, without  using the Internet. AOL, Hotmail, and other email providers can be accessed through a third party program, IzyMail. The program works with a keyboard such as IntelliKeys or BigKeys (see entries); a pointing device such as Magic Touchscreen, SAM-Joystick, or SAM-Trackball; or CrossScanner for single switch (see entries). The program can also be operated by voice, even the voice of an augmentative communication device. The program is available in downloadable or CD versions. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible (model SM-24) or Macintosh (model SM-27) computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Any Windows (model SM-24) or Mac (model SM-27) operating system.
