This program can create all five IDEA required documents, including Evaluation Plans, Classification Summaries, IEPs (Initial, Annual Review, Re-evaluation, and Speech), Manifestation Determinations, and Behavioral Intervention Plans and 504 Plans. Most information is entered through drop-down lists and pop-up windows. All information within documents can be customized to meet the individual needs of each school district and student. Correspondence,including labels and envelopes, and Progress Reports can be printed individually or for a group of students. A Due Date Reminder screen helps keep users up to date on upcoming due dates, and a Contact History section helps users keep track of contacts made with student, parent, teacher, etc. A Goal and Objective database includes approximately 700 goals, which are linked to a core curriculum proficiency statement and 7,000 Objectives. The program generates tables required for ASSA and ADR reports. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM compatible computers, a 300-megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; Windows 95 or higher operating system for desktop computers and Windows NT 4.0 or higher for servers; 32 megabytes (MB) RAM for desktop and 128 MB RAM for servers; 200 MB of hard drive space; CD-ROM drive; TCP/IP or IPX/SPX for a network. For Macintosh computers, a 300 MHz or faster processor; 32 MB RAM for desktop and 128 MB RAM for servers; 200 MB of hard drive space; CD-ROM drive; Mac OS 7.6 or higher operating system for desktop, Mac OS 8.6 thru 9.1 or Max OS X for server; TCP/IP or AppleTalk for network are required.
