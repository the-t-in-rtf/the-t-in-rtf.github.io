This portable device is available either preloaded with a choice of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) software packages and speech synthesizers or without software (model MMX-3O) so the user can add their favorites. Available packages include The Grid 2, Acapela Speech Synthesizer, Symbolstix Communication symbols and Widgit Symbols (MMX-3C); Windbag 3 and Acapela Speech Synthesizer (MMX-3W); Mind Express, RealSpeak and Symbolstix symbols (MMX-3M); Speaking Dynamically Pro/BoardMaster, SAPI Speech Synthesizer and PCS symbols (MMX-3B); or Tobii ATI Communicator, Acapela Speech Synthesizer, and SymbolStix Communication symbols (MMX-3V).  Depending on the AAC software package(s) loaded on the Optimist MMX-3, the user can choose spoken messages through direct selection or scanning. This device, which resembles a laptop computer with a swiveling display, is drop and spill resistant, and the user can provide input through the keyboard or through the touch screen display. The Optimist MMX-3&#x27;s display is a 10.1-inch diagonal color active matrix TFT (thin film transistor) LCD (liquid crystal display) LED backlight touch screen. It has an Intel Atom Processor N2600 1.66 gigahertz (GHz) processor with 4 gigabytes (GB) RAM at 800 megahertz (MHz) and a 160-GB hard drive, and it includes the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. All models include a built-in carry handle, water resistant keyboard and touch pad, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a 2-megapixel swivel webcam, two stereo speakers, two 3.5-millimeter (mm) headphone jacks, a built-in microphone, a 3.5-mm external microphone jack, two USB ports, two 3.5-mm scan-switch ports, a 2-in-1 SDHC/MMC card reader, a RJ-45 Ethernet port, one High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), and a VGA output port. All models except the MMX-2O include Bump Sheet finger-screen touch support and a soft carry pouch. The Dialect MMX-3 Speech Generating Device (see separate record), which has all non-communication functions locked out and meets Medicare criteria as a dedicated speech generating device, is also available. OPTIONS: Quick release mounting plate and Abilia (GEWA) Progress Star USB infrared transmitter (to add environmental control functionality). POWER: Uses rechargeable lithium ion battery pack (included). A 100-240 volt, 50/60 Hertz AC adapter is included. Battery life is 10 hours and recharge time is three hours. DIMENSIONS (WxDxH): 10.6 x 8.2 x 1.2 inches. WEIGHT: 3.7 pounds.
