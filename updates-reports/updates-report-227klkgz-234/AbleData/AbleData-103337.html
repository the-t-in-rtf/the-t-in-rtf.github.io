It includes simulations of tasks related to training, education and employment. The curriculum management system starts with a screening of interests (the Interest Indicator) and assigns activities for the user based on the scored results. The system then delivers assigned hands-on activities (the Work Samples) and job-specific, academic/basic skills assessments (Learning Assessment Programs). The MECA System also includes career planning and a career portfolio for post-secondary goal setting. The system assesses the user&#x27;s self-determination skills related to setting and achieving academic and career goals (Personal Responsibility); assesses and teaches social/emotional skills in learning, leadership, change, teamwork, sensitivity, and violence prevention (Success Profiler); and teaches functional life, social, literacy and works skills (Functional Skills System). Finally, the MECA System scores, interprets, assigns skill-enhancement activities based on assessment results, and delivers skill-enhancement activities. The system can create a prescription for learning for transition Individual Education Programs (IEPs) that correlates to standards in each state. The user’s data are tracked, scored, benchmarked, stored and printed in the system. The system includes an audio option for low and non-readers and is available in English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM and compatible computers, Windows XP (SP2 or above), Vista, or 7 operating system; 1 gigahertz (GHz) or greater Pentium or AMD processor; 128 megabytes (MB) or greater RAM; 1024 x 768 display resolution; CD/DVD-ROM drive; sound card; and speakers.
