This application (or app) allows a parent or caregiver to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to help children learn the concept of taking turns in order to learn how to take turns in games, conversations and other situations. The child touches either the animated icon with the phrase &quot;My turn&quot; if it is his or her turn or the animated icon with the phrase &quot;Your turn&quot; if it is not his or her turn. Each icon is accompanied by a recorded voice that is played when the icon is touched. Both male and female voices are available, and the child can select the corresponding voice by checking the box next to &quot;Male&quot; or &quot;Female.&quot; COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
