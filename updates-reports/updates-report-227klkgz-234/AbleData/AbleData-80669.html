Each set includes the CD-ROM software from Laureate Learning Systems (see separate entry) and the appropriate plastic IntelliKeys (see separate entry) overlay. Each program offers several activities: Interactive communication requires the child to select a noun or verb from the overlay, causing a picture to appear on the screen. The picture is used to create phrases or sentences which are read back by the program using the correct grammar. In picture matching, a picture appears on the screen and the child matches by touching the corresponding picture on the overlay. In picture identification, the user is asked to locate the appropriate word on the overlay to identify the picture. Talking Nouns I &amp;amp; II also offers nouns by category, in which five nouns in the same category appear on the screen and the child locates them on the overlay. Talking Nouns I offers nouns in the categories of animals, clothing, food, outside things, utensils, body partscommon objects, household items, toys, and vehicles. Talking Nouns II offers 50 additional wods and pictures in the same categories. Talking Verbs offers 40 verbs along with words and phrases to create simple sentences. Animated pictures of verb appear on screen. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Power Macintosh or IBM and compatible computers with Windows95. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Power Macintosh or Windows95 and a CD-ROM drive.
