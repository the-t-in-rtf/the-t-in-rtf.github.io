The program scans printed documents, books, and magazines and reads them aloud. Text also appears on-screen in the user&#x27;s choice of font, letter size, letter spacing, colors, format, and presentation. Once configured, the program is controlled with four large buttons on a trackball mouse. Presentation options include text filling the full screen (Word Wrap); one word at a time (RSVP View); a single line scrolling across the screen (Marquee View); the original page with a magnified line of text scrolling beneath it (Page View); or an enlarged image of the page (Image View). Text is spoken in any of nine different voices in Word Wrap and RSVP Views, and may be turned on or off at will. Pages can be scanned, bookmarked, and stored for reading at a later time. Templates can be created to customize scanned areas on a page, such as the portions of interest of recurrent transactions or billing summaries. Images can be magnified and stored. The program comes with a digital library of over 600 books stored and indexed on a CD, and can read these electronic books. The program can also be used to create, send, save, and receive e-mail; write and edit memos with a talking keyboard with three speech modes (normal reading, proofreading, and spelling); and auto dial phone numbers stored in the talking address book. A large print/talking calculator is included for arithmetic operations. The program can also display full screen images when it is used on a personal computer with a video camera and an ATI All-in-Wonder Video Capture card (not included).
