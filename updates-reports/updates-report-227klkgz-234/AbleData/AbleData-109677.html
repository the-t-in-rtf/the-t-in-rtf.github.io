This support is designed to enable the user to bring her wheelchair into position and then lower the support so that the computer is in her lap at the necessary angle. A  rectangular plywood base with two vertical pieces at either side was designed to clamp to a table. Another plywood board with standard drawer runners at either side was mounted to the bases&#x27;s side pieces at a 15-degree angle. The mount for the laptop is a third plywood board that slides up and down on the drawer runners and secures in the closed position with a ball catch. The computer is held in place with Velcro strips on the bottom of the mount. The user wheels herself up to the table with the mount in the closed position and pulls the board down over the ball catch and into her lap. The main mounting board is height adjustable using tri-nuts that move in vertical slots cut in the side pieces of the base, making the mount adaptable to a variety of tables.  TITLE: Laptop Support. JOURNAL: TAD Journal. REF: Volume 25, Number 2, Winter 2005: P. 16-17. PAGES: 3 (including cover).
