It is a customizable, flat, touch-sensitive device. Unlike standard keyboards with a fixed set of keys, the configuration of IntelliKeys can be easily changed by sliding different overlays onto the touch sensitive area. IntelliKeys USB plugs into the computer&#x27;s USB port and provides access for anyone with physical, visual, or cognitive disabilities who has difficulty using a standard keyboard. In combination with its many overlays, it provides individualized support for young students, struggling learners, and ELL students. The universal design of the overlays provides large, well-spaced keys in high contrast colors to help students locate letters, numbers, words, and directional arrows. Concepts are broken down into manageable components, with streamlined choices, fewer concepts at a time, pictures to support learning—even student photographs for personalization. POWER: USB Port. DIMENSIONS: 17.25 inches length x 10.25 inches height x 1.125 inches depth. COMPATIBILITY: Macintosh and Windows compatible. COLOR: Variety. WARRANTY/GUARANTEE: As stated by the manufacturer.
