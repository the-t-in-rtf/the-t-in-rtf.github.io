This program enables teachers to create multi-media versions of math tests. Tests can be created by converting a printed test or math book page into an electronic test, or the program can generate questions based on the teacher&#x27;s specifications. The program supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with or without remainders, exponents, and decimals. Test questions can be presented as equations to solve or as word problems. Instructions, tips, and encouragement can be included. Tests can be randomized so they are different for each student. The program uses pre-recorded human speech to narrate every area of the program, including equations. Synthetic speech is used only to read the student&#x27;s name and any directions and word problems entered by the teacher. Audio feedback is provided by one of several animated characters: Eight-year-old Carefree Cary, five-year-old Jolly Janna, or adults Eager Eddie and Clever Karen. The program also has functions for record-keeping tasks, such as grading papers and filling out report cards. The program comes with manuals in large print and a choice of cassettes or braille. Also available is a Pro version for use on up to 35 networked computers. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 90 megahertz (MHz) processor; Windows XP, ME, 2000, 98, 95, or Windows NT Service Pack 4 operating system; 16 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM); standard keyboard (not USB); 20 MB of available disk space; 16-bit sound card and speakers or headphones; CD-ROM drive; Internet Explorer 4.01 or later. The Pro version requires 420 MB of available disk space on the server computer, and 20 MB of available disk space on each client machine.
