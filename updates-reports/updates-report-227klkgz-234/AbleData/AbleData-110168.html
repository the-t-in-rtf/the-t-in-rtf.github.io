It is designed to improve tracking ability of objects and increase the user&#x27;s attention span. This program is made up of 16 activities with an amusement park theme: Ferris wheel, shoot the water in the clown&#x27;s mouth, shooting gallery, knock over the cans with the baseball, popcorn machine, ray guns, dolphin show, bumper cars, car wash, motorcycle stunts, bowling, ring the bell, ice cream machine, pop the balloon with the dart, light the bulbs, and the roller coaster. Each activity can optionally be played with a field of one, two or three segments. The activities are errorless and no prior knowledge or understanding of any of the activities are needed. Animation for a segment is initiated by a single switch, touch screen, or step scanning with two switches. The user presses a switch or the space bar or clicks the mouse to initiate animation. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  Windows 98 or higher operating system with at least 233 megaHertz (MHz) processor, 32 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), and 16-bit color capability.
