The program uses speech, pictures, and animated characters and is intended as a follow-up to the vocabulary training provided by First Words, First Words II, and First Verbs (see entries). This program uses three 20-picture sets to train the singular noun form and plural noun endings. The Six instructional levels include a game, four levels of training, and a test option. Students are presented pictures and asked to select the picture which represents the construction being trained. Various amounts of instruction, cuing, and feedback are provided on each training level. For students with physical disabilities, alternative access may be gained through TouchWindow (see separate entry). COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a Pentium 133 MegaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB) RAM; a Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD-ROM drive. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB application RAM; and a 4x speed CD-ROM drive.
