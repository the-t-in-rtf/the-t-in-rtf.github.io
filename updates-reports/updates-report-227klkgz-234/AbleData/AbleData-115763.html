The program provides reading and thinking skills practice with four learning activities. Each activity features animation and human speech. The main Sentence Builder activity allows students to create their own animations by constructing thousands of possible sentences from noun and verb phrases. Students will gain experience with literal and inference comprehension, predicting logical outcome, and identifying the meaning of words in context. In the Word Bop activity, students use a toy cannon to &quot;bop&quot; pictures into words, then back to pictures. The activity teaches students to learn important early learning skills including sight recognition, recognition through phonetic analysis, and literal comprehension. Students can increase their sight vocabulary with the Word Match activity where verbal reinforcement helps them match words and pictures. Word Book is a picture book activity designed to enhance sight and phonetic recognition skills as well as building and reinforcing word recognition. The report card feature allows parents and teachers to track individual progress and children can print the sentence they create. The school versions and above also come with freely reproducible lesson plans and manipulative masters. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: Windows or Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For hybrid direct drive: Windows 2000, XP, Vista or 7, CD ROM drive and from 150 to 260 MB of free space on the hard drive; PowerPC or Intel processor, CD ROM drive, Mac OS X v.10.4 or above and from 150 to 260 MB of free space on the hard drive. For stand alone CD: Windows 2000, XP or Vista, CD ROM drive, 32 MB of RAM; Mac OS 9 PowerPC, CD ROM drive, and 32 MB of RAM.
