This application (or app) allows the user to use their Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to practice rate, rhythm, stress and loudness of speech. The VoiceChart feature provides real-time feedback on loudness of speech, and it can be used in quiet or loud spaces. The program graphically indicates the loudness of of the user&#x27;s speech with three built-in graphics: &quot;Too Loud,&quot; &quot;Too Quiet,&quot; and &quot;Just Right.&quot; The user also can use the host device&#x27;s camera to add their own visuals. The VoiceMatch feature offers visual and aural feedback on stress, rate and rhythm of speech by comparing a &quot;Teacher&quot; voice recording to a &quot;Student&quot; voice recording both visually (by a waveform graphic) and aurally (via audio playback). The student attempts to matchs the teacher&#x27;s waveform by repeating it aloud, and differences between the two audio recordings are highlighted in the visual display. SpeechPrompts includes a library of 50 teacher waveforms. The user can record their own recordings, and categorize, label and re-record the built-in samples. The program also allows the user to record multiple variations of a phrase by emphasizing different words such as this example: &quot;Do *you* have that video game?&quot; versus &quot;Do you have *that* video game?&quot; COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
