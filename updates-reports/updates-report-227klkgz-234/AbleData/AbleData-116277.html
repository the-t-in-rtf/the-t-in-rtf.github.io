This software allows the user to position the mouse cursor through only side-to-side movements. The horizontal dimension of the curser is selected by moving a vertical bar across the screen. While the user moves the vertical bar from side to side, all up and down movements are thrown out, so he or she can concentrate on positioning the vertical bar over the target location. At this point, the user can either click or use OneWay’s built-in dwell switch software, DwellBuddy (see separate entry) to select the desired horizontal location. After selecting the horizontal axis, the user moves the mouse cursor up and down the vertical bar, again with only side-to-side movements. When the cursor reaches the target location, the user can click or dwell to signal that this is the desired spot or, if it is not clear what the user wants to do, OneWay will generate a small menu offering the following options: &quot;Click,&quot; &quot;Double Click,&quot; &quot;Drag,&quot; or &quot;Cancel.&quot; Again, the user moves through the menu by moving the mouse from side to side. This software is compatible with most pointing devices such as ergonomic or standard computer mice, trackballs, touch pads, sip-and-puff devices, joysticks, foot pedals and head-tracking or eye-tracking devices. COMPATIBILITY: Compatible with IBM or similar PCs. REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP, Vista or 7; Intel Pentium IV or better processor with at least 256 megabytes (MB) of RAM; 75 MB of hard drive space; sound card to play speech and sound files.
