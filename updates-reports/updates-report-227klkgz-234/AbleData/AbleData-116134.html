This program allows a person to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to practice speech sound discrimination and production with flash card style tasks. The app targets the following speech sounds in the initial position of words: p, b, m, n, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, dz (as in jam), j (as in yacht), w, r, l, th, sh, ch. The app features Widgit symbols and over 700 individual target words which target spoken production of minimal pair words and auditory discrimination (identifying the difference between sounds in words). Contrasts for all English consonants are also included. The user can select symbol only, symbol plus word, or word only mode, and a table of result, including performance on each item within the set, can be emailed. The user also has the option to repeat tasks if they are failed, to turn sounds on and off, to back up their phrases to their computer, and to add emotions such as laughter, crying or whistling to their message. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
