This series of 70 duplicatable books can be used by high school students and adults independently or in groups and is designed to make reading and mathematics relevant to students&#x27; working lives. These duplicatable books integrate mathematics and reading into 14 different vocations. Within each of the vocations, there are five books: Mathematics; Applied Mathematics I, Applied Mathematics II, Language Arts, and Reading. Each book teaches a specific set of skills and starts with a pretest. The duplicatable books are available as a set of 14 vocations or individually by vocation. The 14 vocations are: Auto Mechanics &amp;amp; Body Repair; Child Care Trade; Construction; Cosmetology; Food Service; Garden/Groundskeeping; Health Care; Office Clerical/Technology; Painting/Paperhanging; Plumbing; Printing/Photocopying; Salesperson (retail); and Small-Engine Repair. A teacher’s guide and lesson plans are provided at no extra cost. The duplicatable books are available in digital format (Word or PDF) after purchase at no additional cost. This allows the print to be enlarged and the materials to be put into alternate formats.
