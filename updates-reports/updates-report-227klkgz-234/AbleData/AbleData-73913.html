                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Talking Typing Teacher is a typing instruction program designed for use by individuals who are blind or have low vision. Typing lessons, practice drills, and typing speed tests are displayed on screen while being read out loud. Every lesson or practice session is read with pre-recorded digitized human speech, making it unnecessary for users to understand synthetic speech. Digitized human speech is used for all menus, lessons, and help. Synthetic text-to-speech is used only to read the student&#x27;s name and to play back text the student has typed into Workbook, a fully-functional talking word processor included with the typing instruction program for use in typing practice. For on-screen presentation of lessons, students can choose the font, text size, and text and background colors. The curriculum has three levels of instruction, differing in the number of keys that are taught and how the instructions are worded and presented. Lessons teach and reinforce typing, with emphasis on posture and correct typing habits. Lessons also include optional tunes and sound effects. A set of six typing games is included. The program supports multiple students, and will pull up each student&#x27;s record when he or she logs in. A teacher&#x27;s tool called &quot;File Cabinet&quot; enables the teacher to manage entire groups, keep track of individual student progress, and create customized typing lessons. The program comes with a large print manual and a choice of cassette or braille manuals. A Pro version for use on up to 35 networked computers comes with a teacher&#x27;s instruction kit in a choice of braille or print. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 90 megahertz (MHz) or better processor; Windows XP, ME, 2000, 98, 95, or Windows NT Service Pack 4 operating system; 16 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM); standard keyboard (not USB); 20 MB of available disk space; 16-bit sound card and speakers or headphones; CD-ROM drive; Internet Explorer 4.01 or later. The Pro version requires 420 MB of available disk space on the server computer, and 20 MB of available disk space on each client machine.
