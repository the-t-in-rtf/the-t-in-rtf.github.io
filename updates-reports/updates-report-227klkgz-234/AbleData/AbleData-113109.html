The LaZee Mouse SWITCH provides full mouse control of computers or alternative and augmentative communication devices (AAC), and enables users to control cursor movements through head or body movements, while providing real-time control of the left/right clicks and dragging via external switches. The self-contained unit can be head-mounted or positioned elsewhere as the user desires. Tilt-sensor technology is utilized to perform the cursor movements. As the unit is tilted, these movements are detected and used to control cursor movements. The internal micro-computer can generate both left and right clicks and drag from a single switch, or can be used with two switches.  Feedback LEDs are provided. To operate, connect switches, mount the unit in desired location, and connect the included USB cable to the computer. There is no software to install or drivers to load. LaZee Mouse SWITCH operates in conjunction with all existing mouse devices on the computer system. It is completely portable and compatible with most desktop and notebook computers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers, Macintosh computers, and AAC devices with a USB port. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: All applications require an available USB Port. IBM and compatible computers require Microsoft Windows XP, 2000, or ME. Macintosh computers require OSX 8.2 or above. AAC devices require a USB 2.0 Interface. OPTIONS: Replacement USB cables and mounting kit. DIMENSIONS: 3.5 x 1.75 x 0.7 inches. WEIGHT: Less than 2 Ounces (excluding cables). WARRANTY: 2 Years.
