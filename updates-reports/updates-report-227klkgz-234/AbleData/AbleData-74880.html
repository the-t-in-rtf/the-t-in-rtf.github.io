This program allows users to type long words with as few as two key strokes. It supports speech output and switch input through Switch Access for Windows (SAW). This word prediction program automatically learns any new words typed and updates its on-screen word lists to reflect the user&#x27;s writing style and frequency of word use. As the user types the first one or two letters of a word, the program provides an on-screen list of words that it predicts what the user wants to type. The user can then finish the word by hitting the function key that corresponds to the intended word. The program has a 10,000 word main dictionary, every word of which is ranked according to frequency of use. The user can add to this dictionary by choosing to edit or exclude new words as they are typed. The user can also set up specialized dictionaries. An intelligent word ending feature offers the user a selection of suitable endings to words being typed, such as -ing and -ed. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM or compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 4 megabytes (Mb) random access memory (RAM); 1 Mb of hard disk space; Windows 3.1 or 95 (version 1.5), or Windows 98 (version 2.0).
