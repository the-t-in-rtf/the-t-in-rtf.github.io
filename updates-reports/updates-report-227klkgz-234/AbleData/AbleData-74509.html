The monitor must be placed above the user with the face angled downward. To accomplish this, a commercially available monitor support arm was modified. The monitor mounting plate was removed and replaced with a plywood plate attached to the pivoting sub-base with a pair of hinges. Threaded rod, rod couplings, and steel flat stock were used to fabricate a simple crank mechanism that provides 45 degrees of tilt. Careful placement of the mechanism and the monitor with attention to the center of gravity enabled the crank to be turned with minimal effort. The monitor base was removed so it sits flat on the mounting plate. L-shaped upright supports at the front edge of the monitor and a web strap across the top add safety features and prevent monitor movement throughout the range of tilt.  SKILLS REQUIRED: Carpentry, metal work, and assembly. TITLE: Monitor Stand for Computer Worker. WEB SITE: Tech Connections at http://www.techconnections.org. REF: Browse Case Examples.
