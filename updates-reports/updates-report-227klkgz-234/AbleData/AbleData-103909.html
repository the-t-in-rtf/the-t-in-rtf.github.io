This application (or app) offers a comprehensive approach to development of communication, behavior and social skills. AutisMate includes a content library of videos, stories, visual schedules, scenes, and over 10,000 symbols. Scenes can be linked to the user&#x27;s current location through GPS (global positioning system). It has a Sentence Builder feature with a customizable vocabulary that allows the user to construct sentences by selecting words and phrases (with associated graphics) from a grid. Video Modeling allows children to model functional skills or appropriate behavior in daily real life scenarios. Visual Schedules provides visual cues about daily activities; helps children learn and do routines independently; and allows them to associate visual timers, videos, and stories with each task. The program can be used by multiple users, and can be personalized for each individual user. The user can upload their own custom videos, images and audio, or take them from his or her device. The program also allows the user to share scenes, visual schedules, and vocabularies via email. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
