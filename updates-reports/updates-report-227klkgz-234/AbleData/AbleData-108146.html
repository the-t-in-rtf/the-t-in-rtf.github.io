The Focus 40 has 40 braille cells and the Focus 80 has 80 cells. These displays navigate the Windows environment and a new design eliminates seams between the braille cells, making the display feel like paper. The location of navigation keys, bars and buttons promotes comfort and economical hand movement. An additional Perkins-style keyboard is located behind the front panel. All buttons can be individually configured to set up hot keys for specific functions. Whiz Wheels enable the user to scroll by line, sentence, or paragraph, or pan through a document. Front panel select buttons used in combination with panning buttons, rocker bars, and cursor router keys enable the user to select a block of text, page up or down, or move to the beginning or end of a document. Ten dual-purpose hot keys give instant access to many braille and JAWS (see separate entry) commands: enable contracted braille, switch to display modes such as structured and line mode, or perform keyboard commands like TAB, SHIFT+TAB, HOME, and END. Rapid Reading Mode configures the display to use only 20 cells of braille for faster reading with minimal hand movement. VariBraille allows the user to select the firmness of the braille display. Both models connect to a desktop personal computer (PC) or laptop computer using a USB port. Both models include cables, manuals, a leather carrying case, and an adjustable laptop/keyboard stand/handle. DIMENSIONS: The Focus 40 is 13.7 x 5.3 x 1.7 inches. The Focus 80 is 23.8 x 5.3 x 1.7 inches. WEIGHT: The Focus 40 weighs 2 pounds, 10 ounces and the focus 80 weighs 4 pounds. WARRANTY: A 24-month warranty against manufacturing defects from date of receipt is standard. An optional one-year product maintenance agreement is available for both models.
