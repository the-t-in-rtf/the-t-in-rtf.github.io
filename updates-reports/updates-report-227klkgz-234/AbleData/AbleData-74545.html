                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

This software can be used by students to solve mathematics problems without the use of a pencil, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When the software is opened, a split screen appears, looking like a window with two panes. The left pane shows a tree directory of math work, while the right pane is the work area, where math problems are set up and solved. In the work area, a cursor moves to the right spot on the &quot;paper,&quot; guided by the user, and inputs the answers that the user selects. The user must navigate the screen and enter each step in order to solve the problem. When used with a screen reader (not included), the numbers and actions are read outloud. The program also supports braille output through a refreshable braille display (not included). The software also includes tutorial and test modes.
