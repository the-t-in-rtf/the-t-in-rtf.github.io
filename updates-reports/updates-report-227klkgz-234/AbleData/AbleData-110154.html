It is designed to improve tracking ability of objects and increase the user&#x27;s attention span. When the mouse, switch, or space bar is pressed, an object will move across the screen while music is playing in the background. The objects are large and colorful. Among the more than 100 graphic objects objects included are household items, cartoon images, foods, and many others. The program also includes 35 different songs. The user can press a switch, the space bar, or click the mouse to initiate animation. This customizable software enables users to add their own graphics and songs. Songs are in &quot;Wave&quot; format and graphics are in JPEG format. Examples of some graphics one might add may include pictures of the user, favorite toys, or any other familiar picture taken from a digital camera or scanner. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  Windows 98 or later operating system with a 133 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor, 150 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), and 16-bit color capability.
