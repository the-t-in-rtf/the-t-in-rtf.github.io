                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>The Fling Mini is a joystick interface for touch screen designed for use with smartphones or other handheld devices with a touch screen for individuals with neuromuscular disabilities that result in weakness in the hands. Sold in pairs, it can be used with any game that has an on-screen joystick on the Apple iPhone or iPod touch or any Android smartphone. Each unit is made from anodized aluminum and transparent engineering-grade resin that is tough and flexible. The joystick stays in place on a screen by means of two suction cups, which provide a secure but removable grip. The Fling should be placed over the game&#x27;s onscreen joystick. The joystick has a mechanical spring that is tuned to provide the proper amount of resistance for precision control. The joystick and suction cups do not damage the touch screen. The user positions the Fling Mini&#x27;s center control over the directional pad in the game, which is usually found in the bottom left corner of the screen. The joystick comes in pairs for games with dual controls. To navigate through the game, the user presses the thumb on the joystick. As the user controls a game, this joystick pushes gently back towards the center position.  This haptic feedback guides and stabilizes game play, making every action more accurate. When the device&#x27;s screen illuminates, it shines through the resin base and suction cup, so the user can see the screen and game action. There are hundreds of compatible games that can be played with these joysticks, including Robokill, Joypad Elite, Aralon: Sword and Shadow, Super Mega Worm, Meteor Blitz, Dink Smallwood, and Blade of Betrayal. Compatible apps have compatibility information in their app description on iTunes or Google Play. A microfiber storage bag is included, which can also be used to wipe the screen clean. When not in use, the joystick can be attached to the back of a smartphone, or stored in the included bag.
