In this game, the player must successfully complete a series of missions that start with landing on the southern coast of an enemy held peninsula and continue as the player&#x27;s tank makes its way north through six sectors of enemy held territory. Surviving tanks will be picked up on the northern coast of the peninsula by a tank transport. The player is equipped with standard shells, armor piercing shells, guided missiles, cruise missiles, interceptor missiles, a machine gun with armor piercing bullets, a supply of proximity triggered mines, and a quantity of smoke for defensive purposes. This self-voicing action strategy game has surround sound that includes targeting systems, recommendations from the tank crew, and sounds of approaching enemy and environmental ambiance. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium processor with 233 Megahertz (MHz) or higher; 32 megabytes of memory; Windows 98 or higher operating system; Microsoft DirectX version 7 software (included on the game CD); Windows supported 16 bit stereo sound card.
