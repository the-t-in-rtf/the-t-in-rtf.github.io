                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>First Categories is a language and vocabulary tutorial program designed for use by children and adults with with language-learning, developmental, physical, hearing, or visual disabilities, or autism. The program uses 60 common nouns to train six essential early categories: Animals, food, body parts, clothing, furniture, and vehicles. Activities include: Item Array- Inclusion (helps students grasp the concept of categorization by grouping items from the same category); Single Item - Inclusion (the student is asked to select an item that belongs to a particular category; Single Item - Exclusion (the student is asked to find the item that does not belong to a particular category); Build-a-Category (a single switch activity that introduces one item at a time and then allows the student to see all of the items in a category together); Robot Review (each time the student selects an item, the narrator names that item and its category); Find Four (the student is asked to find four items that belong to the same category); Magnet Match (the student is asked to match the item at the top of the screen to one of the four items at the bottom of the screen); and Pick-a-Pair (the student is asked to find two items from the same category). The program also offers Optimized Intervention technology, an assessment and training system that tailors instructional delivery to each student&#x27;s unique needs. The program constantly tracks a student&#x27;s performance and uses this information to provide highly individualized content. The program begins with a probe test and then progresses through the categories in developmental order. Instructors can decide whether to train using two or three choices and whether to use illustrations or photographs. Four examples of each item aid in generalizing the concept. For those who are motivated by visual simulation, animated 3-D blocks and full-scene backgrounds are offered. For learners who are easily distracted, a simple black background can be used. The program also includes the Sterling Administration System, a set of tools that eases student management, simplifies data analysis, and offers new report-writing options. This program can be accessed with a keyboard, touch screen, single switch, or mouse. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a 300 MegaHertz (MHz)or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM; 40 MB available disk space; a Windows compatible sound card; and an 8x speed CD-ROM. The Macintosh version requires a PowerPC with a 300 MHz or faster processor; Mac OS 8.1 or later, including OS X; 128 MB RAM, (256 MB RAM for OS X); 40 MB available disk space; and an 8x speed CD-ROM.
