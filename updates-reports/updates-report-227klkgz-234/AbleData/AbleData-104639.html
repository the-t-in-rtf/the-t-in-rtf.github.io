Ghotit&#x27;s spelling and grammar checker starts by performing a spell check and an in-depth analysis of the written text, suspecting every word as a misspelled or misused word (misused words are words that are spelled correctly but are used in the wrong context). Following this preliminary analysis, Ghotit analyzes English grammar and performs a grammar check based on the words it suggested, taking into account the unique grammar errors that are made by people with dyslexia, dysgraphia and other learning disabilities. Ghotit also: incorporates additional algorithms and rules to correct punctuation errors; helps the user select the correct word suggestion by providing the user a text-to-speech engine, an integrated dictionary, and descriptions of grammar and punctuation correction rules; supports a number of English dictionaries, including US, UK, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dictionaries; and demonstrates a 96% spelling correction and grammar correction rates of text produced by dyslexics, dysgraphics and people with other learning disabilities.
