The designer and creator Daniel Benamy has repetitive strain injury that was brought on by using a traditional mouse over an extended period of time. Benamy created the Up Mouse as a prototype alternative to the traditional push down computer mouse. This wired mouse is shaped like a standard mouse and has a &quot;U&quot; shaped piece that attaches to the sides of the mouse near the front like a handle. When the user places a hand on the mouse, the extra piece extend over the fingers. The buttons on the Up Mouse are activated when the user lifts the fingers and moves the &quot;U&quot; piece upward.  This creates a different motion and can relieve the pain cause by repetitive strain injury. The Up Mouse does not have a scroll wheel. Benamy had originally planned to add one but could not implement it into the design. The Up Mouse is compatible for left-handed and right-handed mouse users. AUTHOR: Dave LeClair.
