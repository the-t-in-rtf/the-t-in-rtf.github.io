This program has the capability to handle complex conversations, including questions and answers. It also offers specialized phone features and the capability to receive calls. Used in conjunction with QualiSpeak (see entry), the program enables the user to dial the desired number. The user composes one or more messages and enters the phone number using QualiKey (see entry) or by selecting it from the personal phone book. The program dials the desired number and reads the prepared message through the telephone. The recipient&#x27;s reply is broadcast over the computer speakers, or for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, written to the computer monitor using QualiDict (see entry). The user can compose an immediate reply or start the next message for the software to read, enabling a live, two-way conversation. Users without speech disabilities can speak directly to the other party through the computer&#x27;s microphone. Phone numbers also can be composed and calls activated by voice command. The user can save, add, edit, or cancel phone numbers from the personal address book. The system can also make Internet phone calls. QualiSet for Qualiphone (included) enables users to customize and save settings for the program. Configurations can be saved for multiple users in a choice of languages. The system also includes software interfaces for USB, PCI, and internal analog modems with voice features. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: High-quality voice modem.
