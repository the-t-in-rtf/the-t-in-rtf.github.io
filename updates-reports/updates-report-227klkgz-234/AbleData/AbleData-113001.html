This speech-enabling solution helps bring sites in line with Section 508 and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). This application reads web content aloud in a high quality voice. Making a site BrowseAloud-enabled is done remotely, so no changes to the site are required. The client plug-in technology ensures a webmaster has no software to install on a webserver. The application is able to automatically speak new content when a website is updated. The webmaster can select the voice that will be used to read the site, how the voice pronounces words, and the language used when a BrowseAloud user visits the website. The website visitors using BrowseAloud can change the voice they are using, change the reading speed of the chosen reading voice, define  shortcuts/hotkeys to start and stop reading,
                                Re-define how words are pronounced, and choose to
                                have the program start when the computer starts. The software also offers a dual color highlighting system that highlights the section of the page being read and the particular word being read. Reading continues until the program is instructed to stop. For the end user, Browsealoud requires a small (13 to 14 megabytes) firewall-friendly download. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible personal (PC) computers or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: PCs require 14 megabytes (MB) free hard drive space and sound card and speakers. Mac requires Operating System X 10.3.9 or later, minimum of 256 MB RAM (512 MB recommended), compatibility with Power PC or Intel processor, sound card and speakers, 20 MB free disk space, and the Safari Browser.
