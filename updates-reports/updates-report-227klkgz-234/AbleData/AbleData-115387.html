This program enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The user types in words or sentences he/she wants to communicate, touches the speaker button, and the program will speak the words out loud using the device’s speaker. The program allows the user to communicate faster by reducing the number of key strokes required to construct sentences using its word prediction feature, which has adaptive learning capabilities so that its accuracy improves over time. The user can save words and sentences to a favorites list for future using. Other features include landscape or portrait mode, three available natural sounding voices, adjustable volume and speed for voices, and a list or recently spoken sentences for quick access. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.1 or later.
