This mathematical software enables children to record their arithmetic and algebra exercises and homework via the button bar, keyboard, or switches without having to resort to the complexities of a spreadsheet. Numbers are entered into grid locations on the screen, using the keyboard or switches with SAW (Switch Access for Windows) Selection Sets. The pupil then navigates through the grid by means of the arrow keys, mouse, or switch. Automatic navigation options are available for left and right movements as numbers are entered. There are also extra navigational tools to assist with addition and multiplication for add and carry movements on the grid. Letters and numbers can be entered in super or subscript sizes and lines can be drawn around any numbers or blocks of figures. The size of the grid can be changed to suit the user, as can the color of the writing, grid, and paper. The grid can be removed for printing. This program is compatible with AccessMaths (see separate entry) and work can be freely copied between the two programs. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95 or 98.1 operating system; 4 megabytes (Mb) random access memory (RAM); 300 kilobytes (Kb) of hard disk space.
