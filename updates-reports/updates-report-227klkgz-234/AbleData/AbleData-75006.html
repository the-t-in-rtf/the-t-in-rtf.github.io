It links the development of keyboard awareness to early literacy skills. It is suitable for young children or older pupils with learning difficulties. Users develop keyboard skills through picture matching, letter recognition, word building, and spelling exercises. The location of keys is taught by matching letters with pictures and speech. The program includes word lists, color pictures and symbols, and speech. New word lists can also be defined by the teacher. This program uses pictures, animation, speech, and sound to reinforce successful completion of tasks. Activity screens can be printed to follow-up work away from the computer. When an activity is completed, a simple record sheet can be displayed or printed to use as a reward, or to help monitor progress. The program has seven types of activities: In Picture Match, a picture prompt is used to show the location of a letter key. Matching this to a target picture reveals the letter on the keyboard. In Initial Letter, a letter key is matched to the initial letter of a picture prompt. In Letter Match, a letter on the keyboard is matched to the target letter on the screen. Correct matching causes a picture to be displayed. In Find Keys, a keyboard is displayed on the screen with the letters hidden. The keys are revealed when the initial letter is identified in response to a picture prompt. In Word Building, a word is built sequentially to match the picture prompt. In Missing Letter, the word for the picture prompt is displayed with a missing letter. Users type the missing letter, or select it with the mouse from an on-screen keyboard. In Picture Spell, the Look/Cover/Write method is used to practice spelling. A picture prompt is displayed, with the word spoken if speech is available on the user&#x27;s computer. When the user is ready to spell the word, the user presses a key which hides the word. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows operating system; CD-ROM drive.
