This software creates a written transcript of existing audio or video content, and automatically captions live audio content as it occurs. It can be used in classrooms, business meetings, and other situations in which presentations are made. The speaker spends approximately an hour creating a voice profile that helps the program learn his or her particular speech patterns. During the presentation, the speaker speaks into a wireless microphone that transmits the audio to the program&#x27;s speech recognition software. Captions are generated in real time, presented on a screen and saved for later use. The program digitizes the speech, producing both a transcription and an audio recording. The audience can obtain a raw, unedited transcript immediately following the presentation. Speakers can then edit the transcript to correct recognition errors or provide additional information, and post the notes on the Web in various accessible formats, including searchable transcripts, synchronous multimedia and digital audio. This helps enable greater access for those who are deaf, hard of hearing or who have mobility or learning disabilities. The software allows speakers to talk naturally, without interjecting punctuation marks such as &quot;period&quot; or &quot;comma.&quot; When a speaker pauses, the program skips to a new line, making the screen display and resulting transcript more readable. The editing system provides the option to have speech recognition errors written out phonetically to aid in comprehension. Audio, captions, and visual information are automatically synchronized to create accessible learning materials.
