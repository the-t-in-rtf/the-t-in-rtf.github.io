WYNN can read aloud ASCII text files, standard word processing files, digital talking books (DAISY and NIMAS), PDF files, web pages, and e-mail using RealSpeak Solo, which offers multiple voices and languages. Text is highlighted as it is read, and the user can control the speed at which text is read. WYNN can create and edit text and word processing files and convert them to PDF. It also includes word prediction and dictionary functions. WYNN offers a fully functional web browser that has pop-up blocking, and it is compatible with Java, Flash and WebCT. It offers specialized, icon-driven toolbars for specific functions, including web browsing, reading, writing, studying, and file management. WYNN Wizard includes an optical character recognition (OCR) program that can convert a scanned document into readable text that can be displayed in its original format or as text alone. Each software package includes a CD, a set of manuals, and a microphone. WYNN can be purchased for a single computer or for installation on a network. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version requires Pentium or higher processor running at least 400 megahertz (MHz); Windows 2000, XP, or Vista operating system (the network version requires Windows XP, 2003 Server or 2000, or Novell Netware 6.0); 128 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM); 400 MB of available hard disk space (1 GB if installing RealSpeak Solo voices); SoundBlaster 16-compatible or better sound card with microphone and speaker or headphones; a video card and monitor capable of VGA video in 800 x 600 resolution with 16-bit color mode or greater; an Internet connection, plus an ISP (Internet Service Provider); a CD ROM or R/W drive; and for the OCR feature in WYNN Wizard, a supported TWAIN-compatible scanner.
