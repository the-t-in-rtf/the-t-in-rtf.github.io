This self-contained unit consists of a microprocessor that can be implemented to provide recordings serving safety; instruction; security; or information purposes. It is designed to interface with electrical signals (i.e. analog or digital - household appliances/electrical devices) triggered by various types of sensors (i.e. pressure, infrared, heat) or by serial port data. The audio recordings, in the form of digitally coded data, are stored on electronically programmable read-only memory (EPROM) and converted to an analog signal that is amplified (1.25 watts) through a standard 8 ohm speaker (volume adjustable). This product is also engineered to play multiple messages of varying lengths with a total playback capacity of four minutes on 8 megabits of EPROM memory. It is also possible to allow multiple sounds to be digitally mixed together into a single audio output; for instance, words may be spoken over music. Overall, this audio unit is constructed in a solid state condition with no moving parts and is designed for maintenance-free use. COMPATIBILITY: The unit can be applied to security systems, safety awareness systems, or transportation broadcast systems among others. OPTIONS: The audio data can be edited to suit user requirements; production assistance is available for many languages. The unit can either be encased or be left as an open board, depending on the application. POWER: 12-volts direct current (VDC). DIMENSIONS: (Length x Width) - 3.6 x 3.95 inches. WEIGHT: 3 ounces. WARRANTY: 1-year guarantee from the date of ownership. If the unit fails to operate as specified and has not been tampered with or abused, simply return it for repair or replacement.
