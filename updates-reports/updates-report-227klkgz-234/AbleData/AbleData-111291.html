This software is designed for independent use by students who are developmentally between the ages of 2 to 9, easily distracted or overloaded, not well self-directed or motivated, have difficulty following directions,
                                require moderate to substantial repetition, and need maintenance of previously learned materials. The software is designed to motivate individuals to perform tasks which they may not want to learn or may find difficult to learn by providing hundreds of colorful, interesting, and fun reinforcers. A teacher or parent can add reinforcers. Learning is broken down into appropriate steps for low- to high-functioning students. The program supports mouse, touch screen, double switch, and single switch input devices. The software features over 160 content programs, including skill areas such as Matching, Identification, Counting, Phonics, Classification, Sequencing, Spatial Relations, Math, Time, Money, Word Analysis, Wh Questions, and Word Recognition. Students are taught about objects, colors, numbers, shapes, body parts, addition, money counting, time recognition, months, survival words, synonyms, and math word problems. The software collects data on each trial and provides reports that can be used for evaluating the learner&#x27;s progress and performance, and to modify their programs.
