                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>LanguageLinks is a language tutorial and assessment evaluation test designed for use with children in grades Kindergarten through eight with autism, developmental disabilities, language-learning disabilities, low vision, or hearing disabilities. This program offers a comprehensive, research-based approach to syntax assessment and intervention. It is a six-level series which takes children from the early two-word stage through mastery of more than 75 grammatical forms. LanguageLinks features Optimized Intervention technology, a system that tailors instructional delivery to each student&#x27;s unique needs. The program begins with an assessment and then tracks detailed information about a student&#x27;s performance and automatically guides the student through the curriculum. Reinforcement animations are not only entertaining, but also include enriched language which has been shown to facilitate language development. At the end of each session, instructors can quickly review a student&#x27;s performance and and print comprehensive reports to ensure accountability. The software is designed to be used independently, so students can benefit from language instruction in their own classrooms. The first level introduces the possessive “s,” trains regular noun plurals, the determiner “No,” pronouns, and copular “Be.” The next level in the progression trains third-person pronouns, location determiners, pegation and present progressive and regular past tense verb forms. The third level continues with plural determiners, pronouns, and noun/verb agreement using present progressive verb forms. The fourth level trains more pronoun forms, negation, and noun/verb agreement. The fifth level in the series trains additional pronouns, future modal “Will,” and third-person noun/verb agreement. The final level trains regular and reflexive pronouns, possessive “s,” and present passive. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For computers running Windows: Windows® System Requirements: 300 megaHertz (MHz) processor or faster; Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista or later; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM ; 40 MB available disk space; Windows- compatible sound card; 8x speed CD-ROM; and a monitor with 800 x 600 resolution. For Macintosh computers: 300 MHz or faster PowerPC or Intel processor; Mac OS 8.1 or later, including any OS X; 128 MB RAM (256 MB RAM for OS X); 40 MB available disk space; 8x speed CD-ROM; and a monitor with 800 x 600 resolution.
