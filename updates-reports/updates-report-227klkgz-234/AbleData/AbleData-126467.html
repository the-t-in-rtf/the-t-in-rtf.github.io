The user will scan (passing the nib across a word) and the pen instantly displays and pronounces the word and its definition. Features an embedded camera and OCR technology which enables lookup or translation of words without the need for a single &quot;click&quot;. The Pen hosts nine Oxford Academic and English Language Teaching (ELT) dictionaries supporting six different languages (English, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish).
                                
                                It can be used for electronic note taking by scanning lines of text and uploading to a computer. Can be used by students, teachers and professionals to capture information. No software is required to upload the text - the user will connect the Pen to a computer with included USB cable and it appears as an external hard drive. Text is stored and transferred as a .txt file.
