This dictionary is designed to work with screen readers and screen magnifiers and contains over 250,000 words and phrases, including jargon and proper nouns such as geographic locations and historical persons. It reads the definition of a word to the user as well as how to use it in a sentence. This program also highlights the word on the screen as it reads and has a built-in complete thesaurus for finding synonyms and antonyms and their corresponding definitions. Words can be displayed in large print up to 400 percent of their original size. The &quot;Power Search&quot; feature lets the user look up words with only a partial spelling. Interlink technology enables the user to find related terms and definitions with only a vague concept of a word. The spelling feature provides the user with a list of potential words similar in spelling to the word he or she is trying to spell. The user can find the definition of a term within a definition with &quot;Recursive lookup.&quot; The &quot;Hot key lookup&quot; feature allows the user to highlight a word in a document, web page or email and press the F11 hot key to look up the definition without interrupting the reading flow. The dictionary keeps a history of all the words the user looks up in particular session and he/she can go back to the previous word by clicking the &quot;Back&quot; button. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM compatible computers, Windows XP, Vista, or 7 operating system; 1 gigabytes (GB) or greater RAM; Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher; 1024 x 768 pixels or higher display resolution. For Macintosh computers, Mac OS X 10.5 to 10.7; Intel processor; 512 megabytes (MB) or greater RAM.
