This computer-based system converts speech to text, speech to video sign language, speech to computer-generated voice, and text to computer-generated voice all in real time. Features include the ability to adjust the font size and text window display, the ability to adjust the signing speed and the size of the signing window (custom mode), location of a sign using the word list feature, user-selected speaking voice (e.g., male or female), and adjustable pitch and rate of the computer-generated speech. The system enables users to deliver written manuscripts and reports using computer-generated speech and listen to stories or lectures delivered via computer-generated speech. The system also enables users to save text for later use, editing, or clarification, use the iText tool to have email, web pages, and other documents signed and/or spoken through the iCommunicator program , insert notes into real time text for later reference, and formulate questions and statements for immediate response in class, during meetings, or personal conversations. Users can also prepare and execute ideas, formulated statements and questions using Quick Say/Edit function keys, quickly navigate the keyboard using hotkeys, choose a desirable, personalized color scheme, select a comfortable mode of computer use (either standard mode or custom mode lock signing, if preferred), protect notes by using Autosave and selecting the time interval, and eliminate unwanted translations by monitoring the onscreen microphone ON/OFF button. The system includes: Software Setup CDs, Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional (see also separate entry), LightSpeed Wireless Microphone System, Visikey Wireless Keyboard (see also separate entry), PS2 to USB adapter, iCommunicator Hardware Security Key, two audio cables, iCommunicator Installation Guide, iCommunicator Training Manual, and an iCommunicator User Guide. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible high-end laptop computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium III, 800 megaHertz (mHz) or faster processor (1 gigaHertz recommended), 256 megabytes (MB) minimum RAM (512 MB recommended), 2 gigabytes (GB) free hard drive space, paralell port to attach hardware security key, 8 MB video, 24X CD drive or DVD-ROM, SoundBlaster Pro or compatible sound card, 800 x 600 high quality screen resolution, Word processing program, and Windows XP, 2000, or 98SE(2000 or XP recommended). WARRANTY: Warranty software support (90 days telephone and online support).
