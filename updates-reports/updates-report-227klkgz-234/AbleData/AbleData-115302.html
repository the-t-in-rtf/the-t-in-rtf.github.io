This low vision reading system reads aloud almost any printed material. The unit is composed of a rectangular base with a camera mounted on at the top of an arm that extends from the center of one of the sides of the base. Some controls are located on the side of the base opposite the camera&#x27;s support arm, and there is a handheld keypad that connects to the base with a cable. When a document, book or newspaper is placed on its base, the Eye-Pal SOLO LV begins to read the text aloud within seconds, regardless of the page&#x27;s orientation. Reading can be controlled with the unit&#x27;s controls, or hand movements made between the camera and the material can be used to pause and start the reading without touching the buttons. Up to four pages can be saved. To be used for magnification, the unit must be connected to a monitor or television. When a document is placed under the camera, the magnified text appears on the screen in a few seconds. Magnified text can be highlighted as it is read aloud. Magnified text is wrapped within the screen, and the  magnification level, color, brightness, and contrast are all adjustable. In addition, small objects such as hearing aids and medicine bottles can be magnified in three increments up to 12 times their size on a 19-inch screen to facilitate reading of their labels.
