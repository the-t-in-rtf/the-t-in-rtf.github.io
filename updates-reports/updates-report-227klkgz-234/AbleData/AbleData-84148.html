The utilities are provided with the operating system at no additional cost. Sticky Keys is a feature that allows single-finger operation of the keyboard. With Sticky Keys turned on, the &quot;modifier&quot; keys (such as SHIFT) can be pressed before the key they modify, rather than at the same time. Pressing the modifier key once modifies the next keystroke only; pressing it twice locks it on until it is turned off by being pressed again. Multiple modifier key sequences (like SHIFT-OPTION) can be executed using Sticky Keys. MouseKeys is a feature that allows the keys on the numeric keypad to be used in place of the mouse. Since the Apple PowerBook does not have a built-in numeric keypad, this utility set also includes a Mouse Keys for the PowerBook utility, which is used to emulate the numeric keyboard on the standard PowerBook keyboard. SlowKeys is a utility that enables the computer user to have the keyboard delay a keyboard entry unless the desired key is held down for a user-determined amount of time. The set also includes a text-to-speech utility that allows the computer to read alert messages that appear on the screen; messages can be read in either English or Mexican Spanish. Easy Access is included in operating systems 4.1 and above. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple Macintosh and PowerBook computers.
