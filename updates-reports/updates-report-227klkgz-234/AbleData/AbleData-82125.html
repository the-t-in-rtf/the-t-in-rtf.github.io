These programs may be used as tools for teaching cause and effect, switches, scanning, symbol training, phrase and sentence structure, spelling, word prediction, or reading activities. As assessment tools, these programs can evaluate augmentative communication needs, the best mode of access for an individual, the best method of training and practice, and the device requirements most beneficial for the individual user. The user designs the activities and decides what actions will occur when a picture is selected. Selecting a picture can activate speech, change screens, or both activate speech and change screens. The final result is a dynamic changing display of multiple screens. A picture may be selected using many different access methods. Using the Speaking Dynamically programs in conjunction with the Mayer-Johnson BoardMaker program (see separate entry) provides access to the more than 3,000 Picture Communication Symbols in the PCS Books I, II, and III. In addition to the features listed below, Speaking Dynamically Pro offers improved graphics handling, word processing, and word prediction; pop-up boards; verb tensing; access improvements; environmental control unit control; and new button actions. FEATURES: Choice of using text to speech or recorded speech; color for symbols, text, or photographs; sentence building buttons, allowing the user to change screens while stringing pictures or text together to make phrases; auditory scanning; multiple scanning modes including normal, step, inverse, group/item, or row/column; variable scanning speed and changeable number of repetitions; adjustable fonts and sizes in both preview and typing displays; and the ability to bring in pictures from the clipboard to customize symbols or scan in photos. This program allows the Macintosh computer to provide facilitated communication with printed and speech output. MULTIPLE ACCESS: Selections may be made using the mouse, joystick, touchscreen, keyboard, alternate keyboard, single switch, or multiple switches. OPTIONS: Optional equipment or software includes Boardmaker (see separate entry) since Speaking Dynamically does not include pictures; and a touchscreen for the Macintosh; MultiVoice. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh computers. Compatible speech synthesizer equipment includes DECTalk, Multivoice, Portable Too, Real Voice, Infovox, or MacinTalk (included with the program). SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Speaking Dynamically requires a 68020 processor or better, System 7.1 or higher, an a minimum of 4 megabytes RAM (8 MB recommended.) Speaking Dynamically Pro requires an LC or better with System 7.1 and 8 MB RAM or System 7.5 and 12 MB RAM. A switch interface is required if single or multiple switches are to be used.
