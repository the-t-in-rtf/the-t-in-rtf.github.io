An Island Adventure is a vocabulary tutorial program designed for use by children with learning and other cognitive disabilities and physical disabilities. This program incorporates speech recognition software to enable students to direct computer actions using their voices. They can also listen to their own voices as they read the 12 interactive books incorporated into the program. This comprehensive program for beginning readers uses both phonics and whole language concepts, offers more than 175 lessons, and introduces more than 400 vocabulary words. Over the course of the lessons, students meet a raccoon named Robby who needs to read and his friend Emily the squirrel. Together they embark on an interactive adventure in a flying machine called the Reading Rover. They travel to Letter Island where they meet its inhabitants--the letters of the alphabet who will not come out to play unless students call out their sounds. As they progress through the reading adventure, students are rewarded with a series of 12 original illustrated inteactive books, each appropriate to the level achieved. While reading the books, students apply the skills they have learned and they can record themselves reading any book. Once read, the book is displayed on the student&#x27;s bookshelf and can be re-read at any time. The software offers both guided and self-learning opportunities through more than 35 activities found in the Reading Rover, in the clouds, or in one of four areas on Letter Island: the beach, the jungle, the farm, and Vowel Village. These activities assist children in learning to recognize upper- and lowercase letters, mastering individual letter sounds, and identifying letter sounds within words. While flying from place to place in the Reading Rover, students encounter Word Clouds which require them to say aloud the words they see. When the word is spoken properly, the cloud disappears with a &quot;poof&quot; and the flight continues. This activity offers practice in sight words and assists in mastering frequently used words. Since the Reading Rover runs on the fuel of the &quot;power of words,&quot; users are required to visit the Word Power Station to re-fuel. To accomplish this, they are challenged to build simple words using letters and sounds learned earlier in the adventure. As the adventure progresses, they move on to sentence-building activities that strengthen comprehension and vocabulary. The program also includes a Grow Slide that shows a complete list of all topics covered and the letters in the order in which they are taught. As students successfully answer activity questions, the Grow Slide automatically advances to new letters and more challenging questions. Teachers and parents can also manually change the position of the Grow Slide to change a child&#x27;s location in the adventure and monitor individual progress. Also included in the software is a &quot;Dear Parents&quot; CD-ROM movie addressing the educational underpinnings of the program and discussing the role of parents and teachers in helping children to become successful readers. The School version also includes a Teacher&#x27;s Guide and toll-free technical support. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 3.1 or Windows95 or later, 486 or Pentium or better processor, 3 megabytes (MB) free hard disk space, 8 MB RAM (16 MB recommended), Super VGA monitor with 256 colors or more, double speed or faster CD-ROM drive and a Windows- compatible sound card. Speech recognition requires Windows95 or later, a Pentium or better processor with 23 MB hard disk space, 16 MB RAM, and a 16-bit sound card with high quality microphone input. A Touch screen is optional. WARRANTY: The School version offers a lifetime disk warranty.
