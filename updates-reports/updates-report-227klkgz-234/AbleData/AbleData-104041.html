This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to teach a child handwriting while playing a game. The child will learn about writing, counting and phonics of letters and numbers. LetterSchool allows the child to practice these skills as he or she plays four games for each letter and number. The child discovers the letter’s shape, name and sound in the &quot;Intro&quot; game. In the &quot;Tap&quot; game, the child learns where to start, change direction and finish by tapping dots along the lines or curves of the character. The child learns the letter&#x27;s or number&#x27;s trajectory by tracing it in the &quot;Trace&quot; game. In the &quot;Write&quot; game, the child can test his or her knowledge by writing from memory. The app comes with two sets of letters: uppercase and lowercase, and the numbers from 1 to 10. The user can also choose from three different typefaces. The child will earn a star for completing the three letter games. LetterSchool has two built-in levels: silver (blue menu) and gold (orange menu). The gold level features a new set of games and free-form writing. OPTIONS: The free LetterSchool Lite version contains all the features of the full version for a subset of letters and numbers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
