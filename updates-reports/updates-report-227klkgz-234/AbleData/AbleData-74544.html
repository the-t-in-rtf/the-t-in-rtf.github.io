The device provides complete computer control by tracking the movement of a tiny reusable dot worn on the user&#x27;s glasses or forehead. This wireless mouse is compatible with both desktop and laptop computers and features adjustable speed and sensitivity settings to accommodate the user&#x27;s head movement capability. The camera offers a 50-degree field of view and can be mounted vertically or horizontally. The swivel camera ball aids in accurate pointing. Tracker 2000 offers two modes of tracking: regular mouse mode is designed for those with adequate head control and joystick mode is designed for those with poor head control. Mouse clicks can be performed through any ability switch, wirelessly using WISP (see entry), using voice recognition software, or dwell selection software. Scrolling is accomplished simply by moving the head and a mouse pass-through feature enables the standard mouse to be used while the Tracker 2000 is connected. LED lights on the front of the unit indicate when the unit sees a dot, when the edge of the field of view is reached, and movement direction in joystick mode. This device plugs into the mouse port and requires no special software. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. Tracker is Microsoft Serial Mouse, PS/2, and Macintosh ADB compatible. OPTIONS: 100 replacement dots, replacement AC power supply, replacement mounting clip, and a portable battery pack.
