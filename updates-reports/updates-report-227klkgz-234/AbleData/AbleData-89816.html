This self-contained unit consists of a microprocessor that can be implemented to provide a recording serving safety; instruction; security; or information purposes. It is designed to interface with electrical signals (i.e. analog or digital - household appliances/electrical devices) triggered by various types of sensors (i.e. pressure, infrared, heat) or by serial port data. The single audio recording, in the form of digitally coded data, is stored on electronically programmable read-only memory (EPROM) and converted to an analog signal that is amplified (1 watt) through a standard 8 ohm speaker (volume adjustable). Overall, this audio unit is constructed in a solid state condition with no moving parts and is designed for maintenance-free use. COMPATIBILITY: The unit can be applied to security systems, safety awareness systems, or transportation broadcast systems among others. OPTIONS: The audio data can be edited to suit user requirements; production assistance is available for many languages.
