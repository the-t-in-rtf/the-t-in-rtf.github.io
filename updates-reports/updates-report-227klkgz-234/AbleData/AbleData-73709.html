In this game, the player has a hammer and a toolbox full of pipes, and must fix the underlying leaky pipe structures in three world cities. Each city has twelve regular levels plus two bonus levels. As the sound of approaching water gets louder, the player must fix the pipes before the water spills out. On some levels the player must fit eight pipes while on other levels more than 14 pipes must be fitted. The toolbox has three to seven pipes to select from. On each level more pipes are added to the toolbox, and the water drips faster. The player must fight off bats, dogs, bees, and other surprises along the way. In the bonus round, the player finds the match for a dropping sound among six choices. This game program is completely self-voicing, so it can be played without a separate screen reader program. It comes with a documentation file. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98 or higher operating system; Microsoft DirectX 8.0 or higher; Microsoft Media Components installed prior to game program installation.
