The VP EmBraille can be used in the classroom, at work, or at home. The Braille dot can be adjusted in height, allowing to adjust to the individuals sensibility of the reader&#x27;s fingertip allowing for extended Braille reading.
                                
                                Produces Braille text combined with tactile graphics. Unique feature of tactile graphics is touchable representation of colors through variable dot heights. What is seen on the screen is what the embosser prints, producing lower tactile dots for lighter colors and higher tactile dots for darker colors.
                                
                                Features the TigerPlus Braille system which allows users to choose between different Braille dot spacing standards to be embossed along with 100 DPI resolution tactile graphics. The wider paper format helps to adjust detailed tactile graphics to a low sensory resolution helping the visually impaired to get a better grasp on the information.
                                
                                Includes VP Tiger Software Suite (TSS) for Braille translation, tactile graphics design and more. TSS allows the user to create Braille documents in standard Windows programs such as MS Word and Excel without needing to know Braille. Tactile graphics editor, Tiger Designer, allows editing of the print data visualized on screen in 1-to-1 correlation as it would appear on the embossed output. Also supports Duxbury and RTFC.
                                
                                Includes Windows printer drivers that allow embossing directly from Windows programs, utilizing the same process as printing to mainstream color printers. Also supports direct printing from Braille note takers.<img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="End inserted content."/></ins>
