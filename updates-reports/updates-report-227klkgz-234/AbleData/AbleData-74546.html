                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>SofType is an on screen keyboard program designed for use by people with upper extremity, neurological, or severe physical disabilities or spinal cord injury. This graphical keyboard program provides access to Microsoft Windows applications and works with any mouse or mouse emulator, such as the HeadMouse or HeadMouse for Portables (not included; see separate entries). The software includes a variety of features including word prediction, which enables the user to select a word from the included list or from a personalized list with only a few keystrokes. Words can be added to the list as the user types. Abbreviation Expansion expands a user-defined abbreviation or character string into a word, phrase, sentence, or other more complex sequence. This program also offers macro capability, enabling users to enterlong text strings and commands with as few as two keystrokes. The Run Menu enables users to start up to 10 user-selected applications using two keystrokes. Mouse clicks can be performed anywhere in the Windows environment using the AutoClick dwell-selection feature. This feature enters a left-button click after the pointer is motionless for a user-defined period of 0.2 to 10 seconds. The built-in Dragger utility gives the user single switch access to two-button mouse features, including double click, right click, and click and drag. A single click entered manually or with AutoClick can be converted to a double click, right click, or drag. The Dragger toolbar also provides single click access to move the keyboard, hide the keyboard, or size the Dragger. An on/off button for AutoClick is also included in the toolbar to pause the AutoClick and eliminate inadvertent mouse clicks. A Jitter Box feature aids in compensating for user difficulties in controlling the mouse pointer. Several keyboard layouts are available, including QWERTY, alphabetical, numerical, frequency-based, and KidKeys (for young users). Layouts can be independently adjusted with regard to key and font sizes and spacing between keys. The appearance of the keyboard can be modified in color and font style. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, or XP.
