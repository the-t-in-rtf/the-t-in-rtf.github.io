                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Talk Time with Tucker is a speech training program designed to encourage children with  with language learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, visual disabilities or autism to practice a variety of vocalization skills and to experiment with the duration, pitch, and volume of their utterances. The program not only encourages expressive verbalization, it fosters conversation turn-taking and builds imagination and confidence. It features voice activated animation routines, colorful scenes, high- quality speech output, and accessibility with a microphone, keyboard or single switch. When the child speaks into the microphone, Tucker moves and talks; this program accepts a broad range of sounds and or speech. The single-switch option provides the opportunity to work with non-vocal students. Ther are five different activities that accommodate a wide range of children at different function levels: On Stage trains cause and effect; On the Farm encourages children to imitate farm animal sounds; A Walk In The Woods is dedigned to increase the length of vocalization; Fantasyland encourages experimentation with voice pitch and volume; and Let&#x27;s Talk With Casey the Chameleon encourages natural communication exchanges.  COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz)or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT(servers only), 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB)RAM;a  Windows compatible sound card with full-duplexing capabilities; 4x speed CD drive and a microphone. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB application RAM;  a 4x speed CD-ROM; and a microphone.
