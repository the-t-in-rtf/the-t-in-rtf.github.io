The drawer can be installed in any of three fixed height settings and the mounting brackets are reversible for added flexibility. The mouse pad area lets users keep the mouse clost to the keyboard whether it is used on the right or left hand side. The drawer extends out from the work surface, allowing the user to increase working distance from the monitor. When not in use, the drawer fully retracts under the desk. The wrist support is contoured and fully padded to disburse weight and eliminate pressure points. All wrist supports come in a series of three support heights to fit most keyboards. DIMENSIONS: The drawer is 27 inches long. Wrist supports are available in 0.75, 1, and 1.25 inch heights. WEIGHT: 8 pounds. COLORS: Wrist supports come in charcoal, blue and maple.
