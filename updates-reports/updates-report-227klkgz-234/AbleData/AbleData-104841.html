WeOn Glasses are compatible with prescription or sunglasses lenses. They are capable of imperceptibly interacting with the wearer and notifying them of any kind of notice, as well as many other functions which include the remote activation of the photo camera, controlling slide presentations, playing music, skipping tracks or adjusting the mobile phone’s volume. The first prototype of these glasses will be in the market by May 2014.
                                The glasses, connected with an app to the user’s Smartphone or Tablet, interact with the user on a LED, only visible to the wearer, which is lighted up in different colours and different flash patterns to show what’s happening in the electronic device. With this app, available for both Apple (IOS) and Android, the user can choose when and for what will the LED light up: to notifying an incoming call, a chat message, an e-mail, an SMS, an event in any of the user’s social networks, an alarm, etc. Each of these notifications will have a code colour, selected by the user, which enables to interact with mobile devices, even when they are in silent mode.
                                WARRANTY/GUARANTEE: As stated by the manufacturer
