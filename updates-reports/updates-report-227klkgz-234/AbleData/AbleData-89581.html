                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Overlay Maker is a keytop overlay creator designed for use with IntelliKeys (see separate entry). Available for Macintosh ($69.95) or Windows ($99.95), this software program enables users to create their own customized overlay keyboard by drawing the overlay on the screen and designing key size, location, colors and pictures. Keys can be created in any shape or location with letters, phrases, pictures, mouse movements, mouse clicks, or special IntelliTool settings. Once the overlay is completed, it is printed using any color or black-and-white printer with legal-sized paper and attached to the keyboard. The overlay information is sent from the program through the cable to the IntelliKeys Keyboard, which reconfigures itself  to match the custom overlay. Overlays can be saved for repeated use and they can be saved as templates, allowing them to be opened, edited, renames, and saved as a new overlay. The Overlay Maker includes the IntelliTools Picture Library of over 300 images, and it also accepts images from clip art programs, digitized photos, Boardmaker (see separate entry), or any drawing program. The Windows version of the software also offers an easy mode with pre-designed templates, key sizing without grid restrictions, the ability to place graphics anywhere on the printed overlay, and the capacity to make global changes to keys or text. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use with Macintosh or IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Requires the IntelliKey keyboard. The Macintosh version requires System 6.0.7 or higher, 1.5 megabytes (MB) of hard drive space, and a minimum of 2 MB RAM. The Windows version requires a 386 SX processor or better (486 recommended), a VGA monitor (SVGA recommended), and Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. Windows 3.1 requires 16 MB of hard drive space and 4 MB RAM; Windows95 requires 12 MB hard drive space and 8 MB RAM. WARRANTY: 60-day money-back guarantee on the purchase of any item, if returned in resalable condition and accompanied with a Return Merchandise Authorization number. Individual products have specific warranties.
