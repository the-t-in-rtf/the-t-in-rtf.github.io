                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Scan N Talk is a voice output reading machine designed for use by individuals who are blind or have low vision or learning disabilities. This reading machine incorporates a Visionaire scanner and optical character recognition (OCR), ATT Natural Voices text to speech, and ReadPlease screen reader software. The machine scans documents placed on the scanner and converts the text into speech. A voice starts reading the document 20 seconds after the push of a button. A text window shows the entire body of scanned text, and each word is highlighted prominently as it is spoken. The machine can handle text from almost any good quality printed document, such as books, magazines, computer documents, typed letters and correspondence, and electronic mail. Either a mouse or hotkeys can be used to control the start, stop, pause, forward, go back, print, save, and find functions; the speed, pitch, and gender of reading voices; and the font size and foreground, background, and highlighting colors used in the text display. The machine can read text files, PDF (portable document format) and HTML (hypertext markup language) documents, and hyperlinks. Files can be saved to hard disk in text format, and the reading machine can be connected to the Internet or to an intranet, extranet, printer, braille embosser, CD-ROM, scanner, mouse, keyboard, or monitor. The machine can access Internet links and e-mail addresses directly from the document in which they are found. The speech pauses while the user views the web site or sends e-mail, then commences where it left off when the user clicks &quot;play.&quot; This product is available in three versions: Scan N Talk Desktop, a stand-alone unit with software and hardware; ReadText, consisting of software and ATT Natural Voices with no scanner; and ReadText Enterprise, consisting of software and ATT Natural Voices with a multi-user license. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 500 megahertz (MHz) processor; Windows 98/ME/NT4/2000/XP operating system; 500 megabytes (MB) hard drive space; minimum 128 MB random access memory (RAM), with 256 MB recommended; a monitor/display with 256-colors minimum; USB connection; sound card and speakers; CD-ROM drive for installation.
