This self-voicing game uses sound to immerse the gamer in a world of action and suspense set in the not too distant future. The player is equipped with a medical kit, a gun, a knife, and a computer, and must get through the many levels of a top secret military research base to shut down an ill-fated experiment. The player uses the sound of the wind in the passages and rooms, the echo of footsteps, the sounds of nearby equipment, verbal directions, or guidance from the environment analyzer computer, to navigate through this dark world, while finding the necessary clues and tools to shut down the experiment on the ninth and most dangerous level. Braille-ready maps can be created. The sound is multi-layered and multi-dimensional, with up to 32 sounds playing simultaneously. Game play continues in real time and is not move-based. The game can be played using either the keyboard or a joystick, and the player can select five difficulty levels from easy to very challenging. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 133 Megahertz or higher Pentium processor; 32 megabytes of memory; Windows 95 or higher operating system; Microsoft DirectX version 7 software (included on the Shades of Doom CD); Windows supported 16-bit stereo sound card (headphones recommended).
