It offers the user to option to hear the content of a computer&#x27;s display through voice output or read the information on a braille display.

The user can switch between Braille Grade I and Grade II by pressing a button, and he or she can input braille via a personal computer (PC) keyboard. The program runs on Unicode which makes texts in Arabic, Hebrew, and Cyrillic/Russian readable. The program also saves all personal configurations in the user&#x27;s profile. The user also has the option to split the braille display into user defined sections to present different types of information in separate parts of a braille display. COBRA Braille supports multiple braille displays with Terminal Server and Remote Desktop environments. TASO sliders enable the user to get an overview the contents of a computer screen. For speech output, this program allows the user to vary speed, pitch, volume and intonation. COBRA Braille supports the Internet Explorer and Firefox Web browsers. It can also read PDF files with Adobe Reader and emails in Outlook or Outlook Express. The program&#x27;s built-in optical character recognition (OCR) function recognizes text in graphics and images, analyzes them, and extracts readable text that is made available on a braille display and via speech output. The user can create their own signatures and standardized texts or phrases, and apply them any time with AutoText. COBRA Braille&#x27;s acoustic hourglass audibly reports the status of the computer system. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7, Vista, or XP operating system; 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM; 800 megabytes (MB) hard disk space; graphic card; sound card; CD-/DVD-drive; Internet Explorer 7 or 8 or Firefox 3.5; Microsoft Office 2003 or 2007; and Adobe Acrobat Reader 9 or higher.
