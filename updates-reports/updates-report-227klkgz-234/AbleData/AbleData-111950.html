This program uses two presentation methods to help the user learn to read more fluently by taking in multiple words at one time. In Rapid Serial Visual Presentation mode, text is displayed in the center of the text area, allowing the user to read without moving his or her eyes. In Tachistoscopic Scroll  Presentation mode, text is displayed in a manner that forces the user&#x27;s eyes to move as they would in normal reading, training the user to read in a normal fashion. Speed settings are adjustable, as are text font and background color. As a low vision aid, one can read without eye movement. The optional text-to-speech add-on allows words to be read aloud at the same time they appear or are highlighted on screen. Using text-to-speech, students with auditory discrimination difficulties can learn to associate the sound of words with the written versions. In addition to improving reading skills, the program can be used to assess the user&#x27;s reading speed and comprehension, as well as listening skills. A Flash Card Game feature can be user to memorize learning material.  COMPATIBILITY: For use on Mac or IBM and compatible computers. OPTIONS: Text-to-speech add-on and American History, Earth, Famous People, or Spanish test add-ons.
