MediMemory also offers access to the user&#x27;s medicine usage history for the past 30 days, schedule change history, and storage of information on the user&#x27;s medical condition. Available languages are English and German. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
