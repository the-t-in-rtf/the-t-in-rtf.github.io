                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Blocks In Motion is a perceptual training program designed to offer an opportunity to create animated pictures from shapes and colors for persons with cognitive disabilities. This computer program can help to build a variety of skills: (1) creative thinking; (2) manipulation; (3) cause and effect; (4) problem solving; (5) spatial relations; and (6) analytical thinking. It is constructed with manipulative building blocks (circles, squares, triangles and many others) displayed at the top of the screen as well as sounds and backgrounds. In order for the user to create a picture, they must select a shape by clicking on to it using the mouse; then, the user must pick the spot on the screen for that shape by clicking on the mouse once again; after that happens, the shape automatically drops from its place, at the top of the screen, to help construct the desired picture. The program also offers different types of animation qualities: objects can either fall to the bottom of the screen (as described above); move left to right like objects in a maze; up and down; randomly bounce around the screen; or follow the path that the user defines. The program comes with the standard Basic Blocks and Wooden Blocks kit and can be purchased with or without learning materials. Other recommended access is available through TouchWindow and Ke:nx (see separate entries). COMPATIBILITY: Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: System 7, 256 bit color monitor, 3 megabytes free on hard drive, and 2.5 megabytes of RAM. OPTIONS: Other Block kits are available such as Letters &amp;amp; Numbers Block Kit; Toy Block Kit; Big Basic Block Kit; Cool Block Kit; Brain Blocks CD; Castle Block Kit; Jumbo Blocks CD and more. Kits are available on disk for $24.00 and CD-ROMs sell or $49.00. All Block kits requires Blocks in Motion and an additional 2 megabytes of hard drive space for each additional Block Kit. Learning materials can also be purchased separately ($29.00).
