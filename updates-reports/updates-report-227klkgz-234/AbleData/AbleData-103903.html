This handwriting-to-speech program enables an Apple iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The user writes words or sentences he or she wants to communicate in any one of 13 languages, and the program converts the handwriting into speech and speaks the words out loud using the device&#x27;s speaker. Both male and female voices are available. HandySpeech features Handwriting Recognition Technology by PhatWare Corp. and text-to-speech powered by iSpeech, Inc. Context analyzer makes automatic corrections based on context. The program recognizes cursive, print, and mixed handwriting styles. The program also allows the use of a keyboard as alternative input, and the use of simple finger gestures to insert special characters such as space and return. Available languages include American English, British English, French, German, Norwegian, Danish, Spanish, Swedish, European Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian and Suomi. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
