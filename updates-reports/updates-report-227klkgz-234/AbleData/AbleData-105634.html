The software, which comes preloaded onto a handheld Windows 7 tablet computer, voices aloud whatever the user writes with a digital pen or types on his or her wireless keyboard (both are included).
                                The Interact-AS Voice System offers:
                                Multiple accents and dialects for customized speech generation.
                                Shortcuts for inputting phrases, such as keywords, Favorites Lists, Term Expansion, PhraseBuilding, and Sociable Sounds.
                                The ability to record sounds and play back Pre-recorded Sounds.
                                A closed captioning module that instantly transcribes whatever people are saying.
                                Language modules that provide bi-directional spoken translations in 36 languages. Whatever the user enters is instantly displayed and spoken aloud in the chosen second language, and anything the other person says, writes or types is instantly translated, displayed and spoken in English.
                                In addition to the digital pen and wireless keyboard, the Interact-AS Voice System comes with a docking/recharging station, a wireless amplified speaker, and a printed user manual and quick start guide. System requirements: HP Slate 500 Tablet PC with Microsoft’s Windows 7.
