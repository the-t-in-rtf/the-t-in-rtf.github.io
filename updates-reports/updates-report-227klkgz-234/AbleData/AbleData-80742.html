This program consists of a stand-up flip book that presents single consonants and short vowels. The tent-style book offers three side-by-side sets of cards on spiral bindings. Each set of cards is similar to a set of flash cards; the first set includes the consonants B through Z, the second set offers the short vowels, and the third set includes another set of consonants. Flipping the cards creates more than 1,200 pronouncable combinations. The system is designed to assist children in learning one letter at a time and then to sound out two- and three-letter combinations.By usibg the set, children learn to pronounce letter combinations and determine whether they are words or parts of words. Each letter card also includes an appropriate picture to illustrate the letter sound, as well as the name of the object depicted. DIMENSIONS: Letters are 2.5 inches high.
