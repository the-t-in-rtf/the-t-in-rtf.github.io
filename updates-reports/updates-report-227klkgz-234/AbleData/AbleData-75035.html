This product is a modified keyboard with switch ports to replicate the most commonly used keyboard presses for switches. Switches are plugged into the appropriate ports as needed. There are jacks for enter and space, which are used by most available switch software; 0, 1, 2, and 3, which are used by Don Johnston software; left, up, down, and right, which are used by Clicker and Writing with Symbols; and tab, which can help with moving around in applications. Finally, the mouse keys 2, 4, 6, 8, and 5 are included so the keyboard can send mouse clicks, too. Since every switch press a user could need is incuded, there is no need to program. This product comes with a PS2 connector. An adapter can be used for USB or AT connections. OPTIONS: A metal keyguard is available.
