                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Braille2000 is a braille text editor designed for the production of braille documents for individuals who are blind. Some versions also include a braille translation program. This braille text editor is compatible with ED-IT PC (see separate entry) but has additional features. It is Internet-compatible, can read and write ABT files, and can be used to read and write braille XML files and to translate XML print text into braille. The Student Edition is a braille editing tool for the beginning braille transcriber or for transcribers who do not need all the proofreading tools. It handles all kinds of direct entry braille tasks with automated page layouts to aid the production of literary, textbook, and music braille. The Student Edition has fewer productivity-enhancing aids, mainly in the area of proofreading, than does the Direct Entry Edition. The Direct Entry Edition is a comprehensive braille editing tool for the professional transcriber. It represents the state-of-the-art in WYSIWYG  (&quot;what you see is what you get&quot;) braille text editing. A full assortment of page layout and manipulation controls handle literary, textbook, music, math, and poetry formatting.  The file management mechanism is designed to handle big projects, such as multi-volume textbooks. Built-in utilities manage backup and file-submission chores with a few clicks of the mouse. The Children&#x27;s Braille option provides a &quot;grade relaxer&quot; that can create customized-to-the-child variations in the file using only transcriber-selected Grade 2 contractions matching what the child can read, with other Grade 2 contractions automatically converted to Grade 1. The Document Processing Edition includes all the capabilities of the Direct Entry Edition, plus a print-to-braille translator that can work with ASCII-text files, Rich Text files, and XML files of the &quot;dtbook3&quot; type that has been proposed as the digital format to be used by textbook publishers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, or XP; Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher is required with Windows 95.
