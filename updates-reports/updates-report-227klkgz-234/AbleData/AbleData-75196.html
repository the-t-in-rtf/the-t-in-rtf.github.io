The CompuShade mounts on most computer monitors to create a three-sided tunnel surrounding the viewing surface of the screen on the top and sides. By shielding the screen from reflections, it significantly enhances screen clarity and contrast, thus reducing eyestrain and making the screen easier to read. This device can also be helpful to some individuals with cognitive disabilities, since blocking off-screen visual stimuli minimizes viewing distractions. No tools are required for assembly, and the shade is retractable when not in use. Made of durable plastic and polyester fabric with an aluminum frame, the unit attaches to both flat screen and standard monitors and is designed to have a neutral but attractive appearance. SIZES: Small (for 12- to 15-inch monitors), medium (for 16- to 19-inch monitors), and large for (20- to 22-inch monitors). DIMENSIONS: Outside width is 10 to 14 inches for the small model, 14 to 17 inches for the medium model, and 17 to 21 inches for the large model. WEIGHT: Approximately one pound. COLOR: Beige. WARRANTY: 30 days satisfaction guarantee.
