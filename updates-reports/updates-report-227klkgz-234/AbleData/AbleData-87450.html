                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>My-T-Pen is an on screen keyboard program designed for industrial and commercial applications to allow a mouse or any other pointing device (including track balls, pens, touch screens, joysticks, puffing devices, head mice, InfraRed, switches and digitizer pads) to operate within any Windows program without, or as an addition to, a keyboard to minimize movement and simplify multi-keystroke actions to a single action for persons with physical disabilities. The software contains 5 different U.S. (including ABCD, DVORAK and QWERTY) and over 175 international keyboards, which appear on the screen in a &quot;Heads-Up&quot; format and in nine different sizes. These keyboards are useful for non-typists, children,and multi-lingual users and companies. Up to 2,000 user-defined macro buttons can be created that store keystroke sequences to up to 15 buttons. These macro functions also allow applications to be launched by and/or auto-open Macro Panels associated with that particular application. The program also features a 4-function calculator with memory and a savable pop-up calculator tape that will place dispayed information into a currently open document or field. In all, the program features more than 125 distinct functions, including a magnifier which enhances the viewing area under the cursor, customized color, and the ability to assign any of 63 different functions to each button on the user&#x27;s pointing device. COMPATIBILITY: For use with computers with Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP.
