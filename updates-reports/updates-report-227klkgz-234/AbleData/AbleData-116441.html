This application, or app, enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. TouchChat AAC with WordPower gives an individual the ability to navigate through page sets and speak messages. Page sets are linked pages, each of which is divided into a number of buttons. The buttons are programmed to have specific actions, such as speaking a message, navigating to a different page, changing the volume or clearing the display. Four page sets are included with the app: VocabPC in which vocabulary arranged as carrier phrases, interactive sentences, activity vocabulary and naming words; MultiChat 15 for school-aged individuals with emerging language skills includes multiple forms of communication such as sentences, phrases, individual words, recordings for story-telling and visual scenes as well as interactive play and reading pages and social pages; Spelling is a QWERTY keyboard page set with four word prediction buttons and a few pre-stored phrases; and Primary, a page set designed for children that contains vocabulary for home, school and general communication. This app is similar to TouchChat - AAC (see separate entry), but it is bundled with the WordPower series of word-based AAC vocabularies that incorporates phrases for easier language generation. TouchChat AAC with WordPower also allows the user to personalize existing pages and buttons, create pages, or even create personal page sets. As the user taps symbols on a page, the selected words, phrases and messages are spoken with a built-in voice synthesizer or by playing back a recorded message. Five synthesized voices are available. To communicate silently, the user can simply tilt the device to make the message expand to fill the screen in large letters. Text generated with TouchChat AAC with WordPower can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or via text message and email. Text from other applications can be copied to TouchChat so that it can be spoken out loud, and text generated in TouchChat can be copied to other applications. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
