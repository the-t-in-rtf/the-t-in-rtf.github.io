The program features six separate learning activities with animation and sound which provide skills practice in the alphabet, counting, writing, shapes, opposites, and colors. The Alphabet activity provides a word, letter, and animation for every letter of the alphabet. The Counting activity helps children master the numbers 0 through 9 while they discover the effect of adding and taking away. The Writing activity introduces children to writing numbers and letters with ease. The Shapes activity helps children identify basic shapes found in everyday scenes. The Opposites activity helps children build word recognition and vocabulary skills, and the Colors activity allows children to color, identify and name colors found in scenes. Students can learn through prompted direction or through the discovery method by selecting either structured or non-structured mode of play. The school versions and above also come with freely reproducible lesson plans and manipulative masters. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: Windows or Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For hybrid direct drive: Windows 2000, XP, Vista or 7, CD ROM drive and from 150 to 260 megabytes (MB) of free space on the hard drive; Mac OS X v.10.4 or above, PowerPC or Intel processor, CD ROM drive, and from 150 to 260 MB of free space on the hard drive. For stand alone CD: Windows 2000, XP or Vista, CD ROM drive, 32 MB of RAM; Mac OS 9, PowerPC, CD ROM drive, and 32 MB of RAM.
