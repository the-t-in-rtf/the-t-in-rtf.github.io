Parents complete the illustrated 30-item questionnaires at designated intervals, assessing children in their natural environments to ensure valid results. Each questionnaire can be completed in 10 to 15 minutes and covers five key developmental areas: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social. Professionals convert parents&#x27; responses of yes, sometimes, and not yet to color-coded scoring sheets, enabling them to determine a child&#x27;s progress in each developmental area. The ASQ-3 User&#x27;s Guide offers step-by-step guidance on administering and scoring the questionnaires, setting up a screening system, working with families effectively, and using the system across a wide range of settings.
                                A starter kit includes 21 color-coded, photocopiable questionnaires for use at 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months of age; 21 photocopiable, age-appropriate scoring sheets (one for each questionnaire); an ASQ-3 User&#x27;s Guide; a laminated ASQ-3 Quick Start Guide; and one storage box. Starter kits are available in English, Spanish, or French; however, the French kit includes the 19 questionnaires of the second edition only. OPTIONS: Online management system (ASQ Pro, ASQ Enterprise, ASQ Hub); online completion of questionnaires (ASQ Family Access); ASQ Materials Kit, with toys, books, and other items to encourage a child&#x27;s participation; ASQ tote bag.
