                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>NumberPack is a math skills training program designed for children with upper extremity and fine motor disabilities. This software program contains three simulated pieces of classroom equipment: a teaching clock, an abacus, and a number line. These simulations are keyboard-operated stand-alone units with their own printing functions. The clock is a re-creation of a classroom teaching clock with a number of additional features. The clock can be moved forwards or backwards in a number of adjustable steps and can be geared or ungeared. Users can change the color of the hands and choose whether or not the clock face has markings in 12 or 24 hour mode. A digital clock can be displayed alongside the analog one. The abacus activity can be set up to show up to ten rows of beads, each containing up to ten beads. There are two modes of use for easy access, mouse only and keyboard/mouse, and the program has a key delay that is useful if the user has a tremor and is likely to hold a key down too long. The number line can have up to 25 divisions in a range of units between minus 150 and plus 150, making it suitable for learning multiplication as well as addition and subtraction. Both mouse and keyboard operate this activity, which features a key delay for users with a tremor. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 3.1, 95, or 98; 4 megabytes (Mb) random access memory (RAM); 100 kilobytes (Kb) of hard disk space.
