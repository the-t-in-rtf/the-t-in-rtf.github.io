This voice output utility program can be used with almost any word processor program. Every time the user types a letter or letters, the program provides a list of the most likely words which fit those letters. The list appears in a new window, with user-selectable text and background colors. The user picks one of these words by pressing a button or clicking with the mouse. The program can read words from prediction lists when the user selects them, or it can read them automatically. The program can also read words as they are typed, and read back whole paragraphs of text from a clipboard. The program includes an on-screen keyboard. New words typed by the user are held in a specially marked list, so that they can be checked for spelling. Users can also choose to have new words used immediately for word prediction. This program also integrates with Clicker by Crick Software, providing prediction to Clicker while making Penfriend switch accessible. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows Vista/XP/2000/NT and 15 megabytes RAM.
