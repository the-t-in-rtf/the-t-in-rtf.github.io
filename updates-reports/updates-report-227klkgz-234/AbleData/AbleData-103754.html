These applications (or apps) allow a parent or teacher to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or Android device to teach a child to recognize different facial expressions such as happy, angry, surprised, and tired. The apps use pictures of the faces of actual children (Face Read 1) and teenagers (Face Read 2) to model emotions. Each app is organized into multiple &quot;Learn and Play&quot; sections, each with separate &quot;Learn&quot; and &quot;Play&quot; parts. In the &quot;Learn&quot; part, pictures  of human faces wearing emotions along with audio and text prompts are shown one at a time on the screen. In the &quot;Play&quot; part, four pictures of emotions are displayed together on the screen and the child is asked to select the picture of emotion stated in the audio and text prompt. Each correct response is rewarded with a cheerful animation. After the child answers the final question, a score screen appears, followed by another animation. Scores are recorded in the apps for progress tracking and analysis purposes, and for assignment customization. Available languages include English, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or Android device. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later; Android 2.2 or later.
