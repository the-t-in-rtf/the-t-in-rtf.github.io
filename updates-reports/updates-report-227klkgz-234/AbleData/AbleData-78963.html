Family Editions are reading tutorial software programs designed for home use to teach reading skills to children, youth, and adults with dyslexia and other learning disabilities. Phonics Based Reading teaches skills generally covered in grades one through three, introducing more than 2,000 words using engaging, age-appropriate graphics. Reading S.O.S. is intended for students from ages nine years through adult and covers skills generally taught in grades one through four. More than 3,000 words are introduced using a mature interface respecting the needs and interests of older students. Sold individually, both programs enable students to work independently at their own pace as voice prompts lead them through each activity. The programs tailor activities to the student&#x27;s skill level, and students may move to a new activity or have instructions repeated at any time. Both programs also include parent override features and bar graph progress reporting features. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers.
