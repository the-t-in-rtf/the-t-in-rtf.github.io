The program contains thousands of words and pictures that represent all articulation sounds, and can be used to create personalized games that motivate students to practice. The user can add words to the master list and code them by sound, position, and number of syllables for use on game boards. Boards can be designed to display pictures only, words only, or words and pictures on each game space. Target sounds include R, R blends, L, L blends, S, S blends, Z, SH, CH, TH (voiceless/voiced), K, G, F, V, T, D, N, P, B, M, J, ZH, Y, NG, H, and WH. The program includes 18 different game board templates, to which the user adds a title and ready-to-go game directions. To design a game board, the user chooses the number of spaces on the board (10 or 20); selects up to three articulation sounds; chooses whether to have words with sounds in initial, medial, or final position or a combination of positions; chooses single- or multisyllabic words; and selects specific words from a list of words matching the search criteria. The board can then be printed and/or saved. The program also includes 200 ready-made game boards that can be printed without change or edited and printed. The software comes on a CD-ROM, with instructions. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM and compatible computers, Windows 98SE, 2000, XP, or Vista operating system and Pentium II or faster processor. For Macintosh computers, Mac OS 10.2+ operating system and G3 or above processor. For both Windows or Mac systems, 256 megabytes (MB) memory; 50 MB free hard drive space; CD-ROM drive (8x or faster); soundcard; and a video card that supports a 1024 x 768 display.
