The stand consists of two main parts-a smartphone/tablet holder and a document holder. The holder props up the smartphone or tablet in a vertical portrait orientation and at an angle so as to capture more light and avoid shadows, while the document holder holds up a document in the same vertical portrait orientation directly behind the smartphone or tablet. The stand also comes with two clips that can be used to secure creased documents (e.g., books) or small items (e.g., checks, business cards) firmly against the document holder. ScanJig works with any document scanner app to help turn the user’s tablet or smartphone into a document imaging device.
                                
                                Made of molded plastic, this stable scanning stand has non-slip rubber feet for added stability, and built-in tactile guides to help the user properly align and position both the device and document on its respective holders. Users can also remove the smartphone/tablet holder entirely and use just the document holder as a stand. In this configuration, smart glasses can be used to capture the document image (smart glasses are not included). When not in use, ScanJig can be folded down flat, snapped shut and carried in backpacks or briefcases.<img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="End inserted content."/></ins>
