                    This page summarises a recent change to a vendor record associated with an entry in the unified listing.
                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

The program can be operated using the keyboard, mouse, track ball, or Concept Keyboard. The program approaches drawing tasks using geometrical principles. The user defines reference points on the screen, such as the ends of lines or the center points of arcs, and the program automatically draws the shape. The program&#x27;s drawing tools allow the swift and accurate construction of lines, squares, rectangles, circles, semi-circles, ellipses, triangles (equilateral, isosceles and scalene), polygons (regular and irregular), parallelograms, arcs, and pie charts, all of which may be annotated by arrows and text. There are three preset Toolbox configuration levels to suit different ability levels of use, and users can customize these by adding or deleting tools, or creating completely new configurations. The drawing tools are complemented by a full set of editing facilities, including scale and rotation tools. The user can create grids to work on, import a background image, and create and edit text for annotating drawings. Other features incude three on-screen measuring tools (ruler, protractor, and set square) that can be manipulated freely around the drawing area; a zoom tool; a transform tool that enables users to modify an existing shape; a fill tool for coloring drawings; and a joined-line tool for the creation of complex polygons. Users can scroll around pages, move shapes simply by clicking on them, and export all or part of a worksheet or picture as a bitmap file. Three simple educational activities (an abacus, clock and number line) are included to give younger students a friendly introduction to the world of mathematics. Images from all three can be pasted directly into the main program as part of the drawing or for printing. Users decide which tools and features appear on screen, so that the appearance of the screen matches the ability of the user. Switch users can access the program through specialized Switch Access for Windows (SAW) Selection Sets. On-screen help is available via a Help dialogue box and an extensive set of help files. This program provides users with access to the tools necessary for the geometry components of key stages 2, 3, and 4 of the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Curriculum. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 32 megabytes (Mb) random access memory (RAM); 5 Mb of hard disk space; Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, or 2000.
