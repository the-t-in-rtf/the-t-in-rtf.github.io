Hosted on a small, wearable, commercially-available personal data assistant (PDA) equipped with a touch screen, the system enables users to take needed information with them wherever they go, presenting behavioral prompts and cues for the user at pre-programmed times and recording the user&#x27;s responses. The system transmits user responses to a therapist or caregiver via the World Wide Web for analysis and modification. Fully individualized for the user, the system can be used to prompt the steps needed to perform job tasks, perform household chores, tasks to be completed before leaving work, take medication, and more. The unit will notify the user of an impending task with a voice prompt, buzzer, LED readout on the color display, or a combination of methods. The user responds to prompts using the unit&#x27;s touch screen and all responses and the time required to complete the task are recorded. If the user does not respond to a prompt, &quot;ignored&quot; is recorded. If an individual learns a task and no long requires prompting or the information is no longer needed, the information can be deleted. If assistance is needed for a new task or additional information is required for an existing task, it can be added as needed. System features include multiple cueing options, the ability to specify the number and duration of cues, the capacity to provide information in both text and natural voice, and the capability to enable therapists/caregivers to interact remotely with the user. The Jogger system consists of two software modules: the information module residing on the wearable device for the user and management software residing on a web server that enables therapists/caregivers to schedule, remove, and edit tasks and monitor user responses. The therapist/caregiver enters tasks throgh the management software residing on a web server and downloads them directly to the user&#x27;s device or, using an Internet service provider (ISP), to the web server where the device user can later download them to the device via an ISP. The management software also enables the therapist or caregiver to monitor responses and download them to his/her computer. If the device user is capable of scheduling his/her own tasks, it is also possible for the management software module to reside on the hand-held Jogger unit. The device includes an expansion slot for a modem. The system comes complete with the hand-held unit, software, cables, and manuals. COMPATIBILITY: The eyetem uses Windows CE /Pocket PC Operating System with 32 megabytes RAM. POWER: Uses a long-life battery. OPTIONS: One-, two-, three-, and four-year all-inclusive service agreements are available. DIMENSIONS: The hand-held unit is 5.11 x 3.28 x 0.62 inches. WEIGHT: 6.3 ounces including battery. WARRANTY: Warranted for hardware repairs for one year from the date of purchase.
