This program offers a variety of large cursor alternatives, some with animation, that are at least twice the size of the standard cursor. The program also offers replacements for the I-beam cursor and the wait cursor (the watch on Macintosh computers and the hourglass in Windows). Both versions also have an option that automatically &quot;snaps&quot; the cursor to the &quot;OK&quot; or default button in dialogue boxes, as well as the option of having the pointer wrap around the screen rather than stopping at the edge. The Windows versions also include KeyMouse which enables all mouse movement and button functions to be controlled using the numeric keypad on a standard keyboard or using Intellikeys (see separate entry), and an option which enables the window sizing arrows to be enlarged. The Windows 95/98 version also enables the user to thicken all borders to make grabbing the edge of a window easier. The Macintosh version can double the size of all other cursors. This utility program works within any software program. DIMENSIONS: In all versions, the Biggy cursors are 32 x 32 pixels rather than the standard 16 x 16 pixels; the Macintosh version can enlarge the cursor to 32 x 64 pixels. OPTIONS: A trimmed down version called Biggy-Light is available only through the manufacturer web site or in quantities of 10 or more. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh computers using OS 9 and earlier or OS X and on IBM and compatible computers using any version of Windows.
