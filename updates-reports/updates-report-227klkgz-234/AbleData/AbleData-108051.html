The LaZee Mouse Pro provides full mouse control of computers or alternative and augmentative communication devices (AAC), and enables users to control cursor movements through head or body movements, while providing real-time control of the left/right clicks and dragging via microphone. The LaZee Mouse Pro is fully compatible with all hardware and software including click/dwell programs and on-screen keyboards. The self-contained unit can be head-mounted or positioned elsewhere as the user desires. Tilt-sensor technology is utilized to perform the cursor movements. As the unit is tilted, these movements are detected and used to control cursor movements. Clicking and dragging is done in real-time without any software or external switches. Sound is captured by a microphone, processed by the unit’s micro-computer and decoded much like Morse code. A microphone gain adjustment allows operation in almost any environment, while feedback LEDs are provided. To operate, connect the microphone, mount the unit in desired location, and connect the included USB cable to the computer. There is no software to install or drivers to load. LaZee Mouse Pro operates in conjunction with all existing mouse devices on the computer system. It is completely portable and compatible with most desktop and notebook computers.  COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers, Macintosh computers, and AAC devices with a USB port. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: All applications require an available USB Port. IBM and compatible computers require Microsoft Windows XP, 2000, or ME. Macintosh computers require OSX 10.2 or above. AAC devices require a USB 2.0 Interface. OPTIONS: Replacement USB cables and mounting kit. DIMENSIONS: 3.5 x 1.75 x 0.7 inches. WEIGHT: Less than 2 Ounces (excluding cables). WARRANTY: 2 Years.
