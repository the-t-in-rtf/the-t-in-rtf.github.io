The program allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to learn basic number skills such as counting, addition and subtraction. The child starts playing the app by pressing PLAY 0-9 on the Main Menu, and a keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen with the numbers 0 through 9 displayed on keys. The child can switch between free play and structured mode by pressing the STAR key. When a number is pressed in the free play mode, it is showed and spoken, followed by animated objects. The child learns the concepts of adding and subtraction in a visual manner through this activity. The child learns by prompted direction in the structured mode. Numbers appear at the bottom of the screen, and the child is asked to press a particular number. An animation is produced when the correct number is pressed. When an incorrect number is pressed, the app highlights the correct number and moves along to the next choice. The second activity is counting from 0 to 100. The child starts this activity by pressing the 0-100 button on the Main Menu and a screen with a red ball and the number 0 and the word zero appears in the upper left. The child can move the ball along the slide to the left and right and, when they lift their finger, the number is displayed and spoken, as the objects are shown. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
