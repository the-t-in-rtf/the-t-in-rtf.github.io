The Minispeak application program is a vocabulary program for use with Prentke Romich communication devices (see separate entries). The vocabulary is pre-selected and pre-stored; the icons have already been chosen to represent the vocabulary and the overlay has been arranged in a logical array. Vocabulary is divided into two categories: core and extended. Core vocabulary consists of those few hundred words that constitute the vast majority of communication. Quick access to core vocabulary enables the user to participate in conversations at home, at work, or in school. Extended vocabulary consists of the thousands of remaining words that are used less frequently.
                                Unity utilizes semantic compaction, which relies on short sequences of a small number of multi-meaning icons to form words. This communication method takes advantage of the many associations attached to these icons to expand their meaning. For example, the elephant icon is associated with &quot;big,&quot; &quot;strong,&quot; and &quot;gray.&quot; These associations are used primarily to introduce and teach the vocabulary structure. With Unity, the locations of the icons on a device keyboard or display remain fixed. This enables the communicator to become &quot;automatic&quot; in recalling the icon sequences for core vocabulary. Versions of Unity,integrated in Prentke Romich communication devices, begin with just a few hundred words and grow to more than 4,000 words, enabling first-time communicators experience early success.
