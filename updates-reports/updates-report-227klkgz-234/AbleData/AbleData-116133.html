This program enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The user or a teacher, parent or therapist can build one scene with vocabulary by taking photos with their device or importing from the device’s photo library; record their own voice messages for the scene to make basic requests or share stories; take or import short video files to allocate to the scene; choose and use over 10,000 Widgit symbols to use to support communication; and create hotspots (tagging a scene) on the scene and allocate actions to make an interactive picture. The user can also link scenes. To begin using the app, the user can try out the built-in scenes in the scene library, and then create his or her own scene. A person may use a flip book or grid view to find a specific scene, and use the whole screen as a switch in &quot;touch anywhere&quot; mode, using scanning to highlight the active areas and tapping anywhere to make a choice. The app accessible via a TherapyBox Switch Box or RJ Cooper interface. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
