This screen reader program is also designed for those first learning to read, including adults and younger learners. The goal is to make reading from a computer easier and less of a strain. This program is a clipboard reader, meaning that the user or a teacher must highlight and copy text from a word processing file, text file, or web page onto a clipboard before it can be read. Users can also change the font size and style in highlighted text. The Literature option on the program menu links users who have Internet access to an on-line library of electronic texts, with dozens of titles from Acres of Diamonds and Adam Bede through Zen and the Art of Internet. The program has five voices, which can be adjusted for pitch, speed, and volume. In addition to English, this program has the ability to pronounce Hawaiian words accurately. Users can toggle as needed between two language syntax modes, English and Hawaiian. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 3.1 or later, four megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), two MB hard disk space, and a sound card and speakers.
