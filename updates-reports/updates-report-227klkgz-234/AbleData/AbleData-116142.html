This application (or app) turns an Android device into an eyes-free communication device and provides one-touch access to applications and mini-apps built into Eyes-Free Shell. The user interacts with the touch screen to check status information, launch applications, and direct dial or message a contact. The main screen has seven widgets (or mini-apps) which enable quick access to information such as time or battery status. The user moves his or her finger over the screen to explore or lifts finger up to run the widget on which he or she has stopped. The widgets are arranged in three rows of three virtual buttons which contain the nine keys of a standard telephone dialing keypad. The user presses the call button to access the dialer mode or presses the menu button to access the phone book. The app also has two menu pages where the user can place shortcuts to programs they frequently use. Screen reader volume can be adjusted when the phone is silent. The user can also quickly launch the details screen for an app and find quick answers with OneVox, Eyes-Free Shell&#x27;s voice search app. COMPATIBILITY: For use with devices running the Android operating system. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Android 2.1 or later.
