This voice recognition software allows hand-free operation of Apple Macintosh personal computers. The system allows users to speak at their normal pace and control applications by using voice commands to initiate any program or action within a program, to move the mouse cursor and click anywhere on the screen, or to place the cursor at a specfic place on the screen using the MouseGrid system. Dragon Dictate for Mac offers Recognition Training that enables the software to learn how each user speaks while using the software, and it has a Vocabulary Editor that allows the user to add specialized words, such as the names of people, places and other proper nouns to augment the software’s built-in vocabulary. This software facilitates writing, editing and proofreading of documents, and the placement of surrounding punctuation with a single voice command. A USB headset microphone is included with purchase (not upgrades), and the user can also use Bluetooth wireless microphones approved by Nuance. COMPATIBILITY: The system works with most applications that run on the Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Intel-based Macintosh computer with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or later; 2 GB of RAM recommended; 3 GB available hard drive space; Internet connection (required for product registration); and Nuance-certified microphone for Mac.
