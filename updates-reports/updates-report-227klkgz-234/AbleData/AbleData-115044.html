The Swedish firm Tobii, which specializes in eye control, teamed up with Lenovo to craft  20 prototype Windows 7 laptops with eye control sensors built-in which were presented at CeBIT 2011. One demo the company set up was an Expose-style layout of all open windows, and users were able to target the smallest (Calculator in this case) consistently. The level of precision was verified with a simple game the firms created where the user blows up asteroids before they impact Earth just by looking at them. The smallest rocks were only a few pixels wide, and the users at the show were consistently successfully. Tobii and Lenovo anticipate that they will not be able to bring this concept to market for at least two years, and they need to identify a partner. Tobii says that there&#x27;s a trade-off between sensor size and accuracy; the prototype has a sizable hump on the back and a roughly inch-wide strip running directly below the display, both of which are impractical for a truly portable machine. The sensor should be below the display, and it could be made quite a bit thinner—no wider than the bezel below a notebook&#x27;s current display. AUTHOR: Chris Ziegler.
