This handheld computer system provides customized cueing and scheduling and offers flexibility in handling schedule changes. The system&#x27;s Activity Model describes the user&#x27;s activites. Different types of user activities that can be defined in PEAT include:
                                Standard tasks (tasks with fixed start times);
                                To Do tasks (scheduled for specific days, but have no specific start time); and Floating Tasks (can be scheduled anytime in a specified time window). The system also offers Activity Scripts, hierarchical task sequences that help break high-level, multi-step activities into smaller steps. The User Interface is highly flexible and can be configured many different ways to meet individual needs and capabilities. Options include the ability to remove any button that might confuse a user, and the ability to block user access to view or modify data. The user interface enables cue types to be chosen from a wide range of multimedia cueing options, including customized voice or audio recordings and personalized digital pictures. It also enables users to be locked into the Cue Card section only so they only see reminders for one event at a time, while others may have the ability to view the calendar and note info, but not modify it, and yet other users may have full access to all features. It is also possible for users to override cues by starting and stopping them early, and by delaying, skipping, rescheduling, and cancelling them, while others may have the &quot;cue override&quot; features turned off. After PEAT cues the user, it then monitors their response to detect problems and adust when necessary. PEAT is an electronic memory notebook that includes familar notebook sections for calendar, names, and notes data with cross-reference links between them. These cross-reference links are designed to make it easy to access related information stored in different notebook section. Extra large text and pictures are designed to help users with visual or motor problems. PEAT is sold as a complete system which includes software, hardware, documentation, and technical support. A pocket PC running Windows Mobile and pre-loaded with PEAT is included. The touch-sensitive screen on the handheld unit can be used with the included stylus (pen) or a finger. Software options include Pocket PEAT software that runs on Pocket PC (handheld) computers; PEAT Phone, Pocket PEAT software that runs on cellular phones, and automatically dials phone numbers from name cards; PC PEAT software that runs on desktop or laptop computers, where the larger screen and keyboard may be used to configure the system, enter data, train users,  and back up data; and PEAT Link software that links Pocket PEAT to PC PEAT for copying software and data between the handheld and the PC. Documentation includes The PEAT Reference Manual that provides a guide to configuring PEAT; The Administrator&#x27;s Guide that describes how to install PEAT and how to copy data between PC PEAT and Pocket PEAT; The Treatment Guide and Workbook includes worksheets that walk therapists and caregivers through PEAT configuration and treatment; and The Training Manual. Technical support includes five hours of consultation for customizing PEAT to meet individual needs; consultation on hardware options and accessories; and unlimited software upgrades and technical support.
