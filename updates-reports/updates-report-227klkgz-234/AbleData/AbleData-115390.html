This application, or app, enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The program comes with a basic vocabulary of pictures that are categorized. The program can be customized by adding images using the device&#x27;s camera or pictures stored on the device. The user can select pictures to form a sentence. To share the sentence, the user then tilts the device toward the person with whom he/she wants to communicate and points at each card to hear the listener read each word. Tilting the device creates a full screen view of the pictures. Grace&#x27;s category sorting feature allows the user to add images to each folder, delete unneeded images, and restore later if needed. The program also includes an edit lock in the device&#x27;s &quot;Settings&quot; menu to prevent accidental image deleting. Landscape view is available for iPad and double tap function is available on all devices to remove cards from the sentence strip. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
