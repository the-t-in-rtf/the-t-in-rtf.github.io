As users discover the Fripples and the town they call home, they participate in four activities to develop problem-solving skills. In the Fripple Delivery Van, students take charge of a delivery van as they develop spatial skills while delivering packages to Fripples around town. In this three-dimensional environment, they discover multiple ways to solve problems, practice navigational skills, and practice cardinal and relative directions. Fripple Flags enables students to practiceobservation, analysis and build visual discrimination skills as they design flags to decorate the town. At Skate Parks, students help the Fripples perform in-line skating feats. They also turn number patterns and visual sequences into works of art. Creating the customer&#x27;s ideal cookie enable students to practice deductive reasoning skills at the Cookie Factory. Skills include learning to work backward, discovering a sequence of steps, and using the &quot;guess and test&quot; approach to problem solving. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh computers and for IBM and compatible computers equipped with Windows 95/98. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Windows version requires Windows 95/98, a 486 Pentium processor or better, a hard drive with 10 megabytes (MB) free space, a minimum of 8 MB RAM (16 MB recommended), 256-color monitor, a minimum double-speed CD-ROM drive, and a Windows-compatible sound card. The Macintosh version a 68040 processor or a Power PC, System 7.01 or higher, 8 MB RAM (16 MB for Power PC), a 256-color monitor, and a minimum double-speed CD-ROM drive. A TouchWindow (see separate entry) is optional for both versions.
