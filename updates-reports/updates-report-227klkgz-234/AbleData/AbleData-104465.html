This application (or app) allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad or any Android smartphone or tablet computer to answer &quot;WH&quot; questions such as &quot;Who are your neighbors?&quot; or &quot;Where do you keep your clothes?&quot; in portrait or landscape orientation. The program comes with 56 illustrated picture flash cards and each card includes audio of card text. The therapist or parent selects the cards he or she would like the child to see. The child looks at an illustration, either reads the prompt or touches the screen to listen to the prompt, and gives a verbal response. The therapist or parent taps the green (correct) or red (incorrect) button to score the child&#x27;s response after each answer, and then moves to the next card by sliding the card being displayed on the screen or moves to the next child by tapping the bar at the top of the screen and selecting a name. The app will advance to the next card or player automatically when the &quot;Auto-Advance&quot; option is selected in the &quot;Game Options&quot; menu. A game can be paused and resumed by selecting &quot;Pause Game&quot; and &quot;Continue Game&quot; at any time. Results are displayed in a graph, and data can be printed or emailed. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad or any device powered by the Google Android operating system. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later or Android 2.2 or later.
