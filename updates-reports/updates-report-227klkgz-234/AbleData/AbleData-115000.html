The SafetyNet system consists of a base station and server; three electric current flow detection modules; three water flow detection modules; three open/closed sensors; and a wireless handheld personal digital assistant (PDA), which uses the Microsoft Pocket PC operating system. The electric current flow detection modules are placed in locations where they can detect if appliances are left on and transmit a signal to the base unit should they detect a potentially dangerous situations. Similarly, the water flow detection modules are attached to fixtures (such as toilets and sinks) that could be left running and overflow. The open/closed sensors are attached to doors (including refrigerator and oven doors that should be closed when not in use. The base unit utilizes wireless networking technology to transmit emergency messages to the PDA. In addition to receiving alerts from the remote modules, the base unit can be programmed with task lists and reminders that can be transmitted to the user at specific times of the day or when the detection modules sense a situation requiring action. The base unit can be connected to a computer for configuration. When the PDA receives an alert, it vibrates and flashes the display in a specific sequence depending on the nature of the alert or prompt, then displays a text message (or graphic) describing the situation or action to be taken. SafetyAlert includes setup guide (printed and on CD), color-coded cables, and free on-line support and software updates for one year. POWER: The sensor modules, base unit and PDA are battery-powered.
