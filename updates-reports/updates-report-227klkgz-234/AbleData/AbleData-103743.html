This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use their Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or Android device to teach a child to learn number sequencing using a set of three numbers. The app shows number sequences on the screen in the training section. In the trial section, the first two numbers of a sequence are displayed at the top of the screen. The last number in the sequence is shown at the bottom of the screen along with three other numbers as distracters. The child is asked to select the correct sequence number. A score screen appears at the end of the activity. The app is a part of the Shanesh COLORS app series designed for kids on the autism spectrum. It is based on the discrete trial part of ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis). Available languages include English, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, or an Android device. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later; Android 2.2 or later.
