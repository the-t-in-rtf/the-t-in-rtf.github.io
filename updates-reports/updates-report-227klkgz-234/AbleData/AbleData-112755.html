Utter Command is speech interface software that makes computer control  twice as fast as the keyboard and mouse and enables hands-free computing. This software includes a consistent, intuitive command system and a set of speech applets that lets the user perform functions using a single command, such as calling up a file folder or website or clicking in two spots in a row. The program averages one command to every 2.3 keyboard/mouse commands across 36 practical tasks including making an Excel spreadsheet and making a PowerPoint presentation. Other features include the UC Clipboard applet that lets users copy or cut multiple selections that do not disappear when the computer is turned off, and a UC ruler that supports multiple monitors and places the mouse and moves windows. Utter Command comes with a series of self-guided tours, step-by-step lessons, a full command reference, visual aids, cheat sheets, and an alphabetical index of commands. COMPATABILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers running Nuance Corp’s Dragon Naturally Speaking Professional speech engine version 5 through 10. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTs: For Naturally Speaking 8 or above, use 2.00 gigahertz (GHz) multi-core processor; at least 2 gigabytes (GB) of RAM; 7200 rpm or higher for high speed disk drive; and Windows 2000, XP, or Vista.
