Once the Interact-AS software is downloaded and installed in the user’s computer/laptop/tablet, the user can start receiving captions of what the other person is saying while he or she is saying it - all without an internet connection. The top portion of the interface will display the most recently spoken phrase, while the bottom portion will display a complete running transcript of the entire conversation. In addition to displaying real-time captioning, Interact-AS can also generate speech and read aloud whatever the user types, writes or swipes.
                                Interact-AS comes in two editions: Professional and Consumer. The Professional Edition, which offers the full featured communication system, is ideal for those who need to use Interact-AS to communicate with multiple people. Those who need to communicate with only a few people at a time should consider the Consumer Edition (please see separate entry).
                                Features of the Interact-AS Communication Suite Professional Edition:
                                 Utilizes Auditory Sciences’ speech recognition engine to ensure transcription accuracy.
                                 Offers an unlimited number of user accounts.
                                Supports written, typed and spoken input.
                                Transcribes and displays spoken words instantly.
                                 Provides an optional synchronized audio recording of the transcript.
                                Allows users to save the transcript in multiple formats (e.g., as a Word document, a Google Doc, etc.).
                                 Speaks aloud written or typed words instantly so a nonverbal person can participate in discussions. Offers personalized Voices for voice synthesis (i.e., male, female, accent, dialect, cadence).
                                 Provides a Favorites Lists for commonly used phrases, Sociable Sounds for conversations, a Visualize feature for sketching ideas or making notations on pictures, and other shortcut features for rapid sentence construction.
                                 Allows users to hold multi-lingual conversations through its optional language modules. Users can view an English captioning of what the other person is saying and have their own phrases translated and spoken in that person’s preferred language through the speech generation features.
                                Interact-AS comes with a noise cancelling microphone, and free upgrades and technical support for the first year of purchase.
