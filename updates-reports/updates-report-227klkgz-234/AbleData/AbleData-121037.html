                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

The device works by enabling a person with limited movement to directly point to letters, words, and phrases on a communication board.
                                
                                The laser pointer uses a class 2 laser module (the lowest powered visible laser available), that is considered safe because the blink reflex will limit the exposure to no more than 0.25 seconds. The laser is mounted onto a tiny adjustable arm making it easy to adjust the beam of the laser up, down, left and right. This is important, because a person may be communicating in several different positions though out the course of the day. (If a person was using a conventional laser pointer, and tilted back in their chair, the laser beam would point at the ceiling). Using an adjustable mount also means that the communication partner does not need to change the position of the board every time the laser user reclines or tilts back in their chair.<img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="End inserted content."/></ins>
