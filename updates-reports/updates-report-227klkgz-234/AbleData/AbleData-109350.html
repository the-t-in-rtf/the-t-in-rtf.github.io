                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Smart Lists for REACH Interface Author is a word prediction program designed for use by individuals with learning, fine motor, or severe physical disabilities. This program is an add-on for the REACH Interface Author (see separate entry). With Smart Lists, when the user starts typing a word such as &quot;lucky&quot; by selecting the letter &quot;L&quot; on the REACH keyboard, the &quot;L&quot; key opens up showing a list of options including the &quot;root&quot; letter (i.e., the letter &quot;l&quot; in this example) plus any possible extensions (in this example the list might include la, le, li, etc.). Instead of the next letters being scattered around the keyboard, the likely letters are organized in a list, showing what has already been typed as well as possible subsequent letter(s). The user continues &quot;typing&quot; the word in subsequent lists presented at that location, and eventually, the list changes to a list of words. The items in the list can be presented alphabetically (for point-and-click users) or in the order of their probability of use (for persons using scanning). When scanning, the number of clicks is reduced because users make one click per letter after the first letter, instead of two (row and column). Speed can be increased because there is no row/column selection and because options are ordered by their probability. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM or compatible computer. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP or better, Pentium IV processor or better, 256 megabytes (MB) RAM, 75 MB of hard drive space, REACH Interface Author and a sound card.
