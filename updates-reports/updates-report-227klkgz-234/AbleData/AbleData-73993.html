The program can read characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, columns, and tables; the contents of the clipboard, marked blocks of text, and message and dialog boxes; status lines, menu bars, toolbars, and toolbox button bars; line indentation, the type and size of a font, and text color. It can be used to read web pages and with MSN instant messenger, and it supports PDF files with built-in PDF reading capability and/or Adobe PDF accessibility support. The program includes an MP3 recorder/player. The program operates in two modes: Application mode, which is used for text and data input, and Protalk32 mode, which makes it possible to use the keyboard to move the Protalk cursor (just like the mouse cursor) around windows. All features are automated, including button training. For training purposes, users can practice the program&#x27;s command structure without actually executing commands, and can call up a reference list of all application hot keys from within the program. The program is compatible with the Dragon Dictate and ViaVoice voice recognition programs (not included). For web surfing, the program provides access to all the accessible items on a web page with automatic readout or use of the tab key or protalk cursor to locate and read individual items. The program supports any SAPI version 4 and 5 multimedia speech engine, including Microsoft SAPI compatible speech engines installed by other demo or retail programs, if a program lock put in by the manufacturer does not prevent it. Besides Microsoft SAPI version 5 speech, the program also supports braille output on a refreshable braille display (not included), and can support braille output concurrently with speech. A keyboard key re-assignment utility is included to enable the program hotkeys to be changed in case of conflict with other applications. Lifetime free upgrades are included. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Standard version, Windows 98/ME/XP operating system; for Professional version, Windows 98/ME/2000/XP.
