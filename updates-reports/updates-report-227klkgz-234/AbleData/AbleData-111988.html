TITLE: Hospital Computer Stand. The concept for the stand was based on a cantilevered hospital bed table modified to accommodate the weight of the computer components while still being easily adjustable. Square metal tubing was used to make a stand for the table; the stand included a lockable metal box with two sheet metal doors at one end. The box houses a lockable gas strut with adjustable pressure, similar to those used on office chairs. A lever releases the strut , enabling the table to be raised or lowered. The box also houses to telescoping columns which support the table top. The box protects children from the moving parts and also offers storage support. It was necessary that the base fit under all hospital beds and be fitted with the largest possible casters to accommodate a variety of floor surfaces. To accommodate the casters and keep the overall height of the stand within the required range, the metal tube frame was cut short at each corner and four metal plates were welded to the corners  to hold the casters. The keyboard tray can be used by a child in a sitting position or while lying down. To accommodate the lying position, the tray slides out and unhooks from the frame for use in a vertical position. The back of the monitor is equipped with a ball and socket joint to enable it to be used in any required position. A large handle, made of 20 millimeter (mm) stainless steel tubing bent to shape, was bolted to the metal box to serve as a handle to aid with mobility. TITLE: Hospital Computer Stand. JOURNAL: TAD Journal. REF: Volume 27, Number 3, October 2007: p. 14-15. PAGES: 3. (including cover).
