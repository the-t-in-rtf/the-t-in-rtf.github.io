This application (or app) for the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad implements the Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) and Frequency-shifting Auditory Feedback (FAF) techniques by delaying the sound of the user&#x27;s voice from reaching to the ears by a fraction of a second. This simulates the &quot;chorus effect&quot; by making it seem as if the user is speaking with several others to help the user speak more fluently. DAF Assistant provides a delay ranging from 20 to 320 milliseconds in 10 millisecond increments. DAF Assistant also implements FAF by providing pitch shift in the range from one-half octave down to one-half octave up. The program allows the user to control his or her speech fluency, slow down speech rate, increase confidence level, and develop good speaking habits. The app cannot operate during phone call and Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic (not included) are required. A Bluetooth headset can also be used with an iPhone. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.1.2 or later.
