(Complete Language Approach to Social Skills) is a personal skills and safety awareness tutorial program designed for children who have cognitive or learning disabilities or autism.

The &quot;Safety: Leaving Poisons Alone&quot; unit helps students learn about poisons, how to identify them, and what to do when poisons are found. Each unit covers all areas of language: listening, reading, writing and speaking. Each unit also comes with vocabulary, social stories, communication boards, PixWriter word banks, activities and scripts. Students learn to build social language vocabulary, read about social concepts, write about their learning, and express their needs. COMPATIBITLITY: Windows or Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: PixWriter version 3.2 (see separate entry) or higher.
