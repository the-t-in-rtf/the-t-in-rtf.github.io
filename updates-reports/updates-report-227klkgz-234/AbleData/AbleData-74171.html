Users can hear their work being spoken back while the text is being typed or dictated using voice recognition software (not included). Any mistakes can be found and corrected using spelling and homophone checkers. Any amount of the text can be read back at any time. Text can be read by character, word, line, sentence, paragraph, or as a complete document, either during the document&#x27;s creation, or upon its completion, and under control of the mouse, numeric keypad, cursor keys, or voice command. The program announces the identity of icons, menu items, buttons, and dialog boxes, and provides audible and on-screen help. The computer-generated voice and the amount of information spoken can be customized at any time. The program works directly with Dragon NaturallySpeaking and DragonDictate voice recognition software from ScanSoft and Word 97 and later word proecessing software from Microsoft (programs not included). The program can guide users through the enrollment process in Dragon voice recognition software, providing extra training stories and reading out scripts in small phrases for the user to repeat. Used with Microsoft Word, the program speaks out each character, word and/or sentence as soon as it is typed, and announces when a spelling mistake or homophone is produced and speaks alternative spellings when the user needs to inspect them. A hot-line telephone and e-mail service is available to support users and teachers. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Minimum 1.8 GigaHertz (GHz) Pentium 4 mprocessor (2 GHz when used with speech recognition); minimum 250 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM) (512 MB for speech recognition); Windows 98 (second edition)/ME/NT/2000/XP operating system; 1 gigabyte (GB) hard disk space; CD-ROM drive; USB audio headset (USB noise cancelling headset for speech recognition).
