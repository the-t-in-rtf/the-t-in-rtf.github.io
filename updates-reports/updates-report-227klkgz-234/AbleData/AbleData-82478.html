                    This page summarises a recent change to a vendor record associated with an entry in the unified listing.
                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

This fully integrated microscopy system for material and life science applications has sample viewing, positioning, and illumination controlled from the computer screen. Operation is achieved using a keyboard, mouse, joystick, voice command, head pointer, or any combination of these devices. This operation is intended to work in an environment free from the constraining postures required to operate other microscopes. FEATURES: Basic system capabilities include automated image focus with magnification changes; automated light level adjustment with magnification changes; instant video image capture, storage, and retrieval; on-screen sample feature measurement and density calculation; microscopist isolation from potentially hazardous samples; and design fine-tuned to meet exact application requirements (10, 20, or 30 centimeter stage travel, incident or transmitted light, and personalized software). Movement of the sample over an area of 200 millimeters (mm) x 200 mm can be achieved using scroll bars; selecting a previously stored X, Y coordinate; positioning the cursor to the desired location on the screen and clicking; and special purpose software. OPTIONS: Projection of the high resolution display image on large screens; monitoring of the display screen image by television systems; access to stored images by other personal computers; voice recognition system for operational control; head mounted pointer for cursor control; and bulk data storage devices. WARRANTY: 1-year on-site parts and labor warranty.
