This software program helps children learn how to put words together to make simple sentences by providing a structure within which the child can choose what words go together to make a sentence. The meaning in each statement is illustrated by an animated picture. Sentences concern activities such as eating, drinking, pouring, cleaning, sweeping, and household chores. After clicking on the Teacher button, the teacher can change the selection of symbols shown on screen, and set the difficulty level to easy, medium, or hard. The program comes in two volumes, each providing for more than 72 possible sentences, with animations and sets of Picture Communication Symbols (PCS). Control options include normal or inverse scanning; step (one switch) or manual (two switch) scanning for use with switch devices; and dwell mode access for use with head pointing devices. Student scores can be saved to a text file for long-term record keeping. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95, 98SE, NT4, ME, 2000, or XP operating system; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM; 14 MB disk space; Pentium 166 megaHertz (MHz) processor or faster; and a sound card.
