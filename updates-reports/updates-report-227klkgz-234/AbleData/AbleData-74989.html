This music-making software teaches children switch use as they learn to add rhythm to music. Users select a background tune and then add percussion sounds or tune motifs to complement the music. On-screen animation accompanies the music, with new animations appearing when users add drums or other instruments. Many tunes and settings are pre-designed in the program, and the user can add other music files and create new activities. Training activities include trying to hit the switch in time to the rhythm of the music. The program comes with two interfaces, including one designed for young children and a glossy one designed for older learners. The program is accessed through a mouse, touch monitor, IntelliKeys (see separate entry), or switch. Two IntelliKeys overlays are included with the program CD. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows operating system (not compatible with Windows NT).
