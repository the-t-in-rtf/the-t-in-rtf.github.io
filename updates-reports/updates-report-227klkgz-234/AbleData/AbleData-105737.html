Produced in audio format using the DAISY standard, the JAWS Training Bundle is designed to be a starting place for both new JAWS users and those who need refresher training. It starts at the very beginning and teaches about basic Microsoft® Windows® and JAWS concepts. It then progresses to lessons specifically geared for users of Windows 7 or Windows 8, and continues on by introducing the concepts needed to begin working with the Internet. The training then progresses into lessons for both Microsoft Office® 2010 as well as Office 2013. At the conclusion of the training bundle is audio from seven lessons taken from the free online webinars produced by the Training Department.
                                The JAWS Training Bundle, which is self-paced, covers:
                                How to read, navigate, edit, save and open basic text documents using JAWS;
                                Basic file management principles;
                                Methods for accessing JAWS help features, including JAWS-specific or Windows-specific keyboard commands;
                                JAWS-related keystrokes for navigating and exploring web pages on the Internet;
                                Three lessons each for Word®, Excel®, PowerPoint®, and Outlook®; and
                                How to read PDF files with JAWS and use Windows Live Mail and the JAWS Tandem feature.
                                The JAWS Training Bundle is provided on a 4GB SD card and is available in 1 of 3 formats:
                                Pocket DAISY player with training bundle SD card ($995.00).
                                Victor Reader Stream DAISY player with training bundle SD card ($995.00)
                                SD card only ($750.00).
