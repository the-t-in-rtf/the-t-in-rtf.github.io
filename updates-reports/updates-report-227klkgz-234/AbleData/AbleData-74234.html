This video magnifier is designed for industrial use. It features a high resolution CCD camera with either manual or auto focus, and a flat panel TFT (thin film transistor) display. Two independent 20-watt halogen bulbs mounted on flexible arms provide shadow-free or high-light viewing. The high-gain camera can also be used for viewing in low light, and has a continuous magnification range of 1 through 40 times. The magnification setting is displayed on the TFT screen. The flat panel display has an anti-glare coating, 480 TV lines, 1440 x 234 dots (112,320 pixels), and viewing angles of 130 degrees horizontally and 105 degrees vertically. Direct line-of-sight viewing allows hand-eye coordination, and the viewing angles allow more than one person to view the image on the screen. A multi-function control mouse has zoom in/zoom out, brightness, sharpness, shutter speed, white balance, auto or manual focus, color or black and white, color inversion, and mirror image functions. The height and angle of the display / camera unit are adjustable. The camera can be connected to a VGA computer monitor or a television (NTSC or PAL) through Video Out external connections, enabling capture of images to a computer and recording of real-time video. POWER: Uses 110 to 240 volts, 47 to 63 hertz, 1 amp. DIMENSIONS: Flat panel display measures 6.4 inches diagonally. Working distance between camera and tabletop is 5 inches across the entire magnification range.
