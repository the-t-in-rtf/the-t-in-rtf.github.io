It is a collection of seven tools that help users develop multiple aspects of voice control, starting with simple sound awareness. The program provides visual and auditory feedback to help users learn and practice fine control of pitch, loudness, voicing, and breath control for phonation. Activities include: Sound Presence (make sounds to see a dog wake up and move); Loudness Range (make a louder sound and watch a balloon grow); Voice Presence (turn the scarf red with voiced sounds and green with unvoiced sounds); Voice Onset (start voicing to move a train forward); Voice Timing (use sustained voicing to keep a butterfly flying above flowers); Pitch Range (fly a helicopter by changing voice pitch up and down); and Pitch Control (help a swimmer avoid menacing sharks by voicing and varying pitch). Activities feature real time response and animated, colorful graphics. Graphics can be chosen within exercises for age-appropriateness. The school version of this program includes a Teacher&#x27;s Guide and two CD&#x27;s in a three-ring binder, and toll-free technical support. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 486/50 megahertz or faster processor; Windows 95/98 operating system; 8 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), 16 MB recommended; 8 MB available disk space; SVGA monitor with 640 by 480 pixel, 256-color display; 2x CD-ROM drive. WARRANTY: Lifetime.
