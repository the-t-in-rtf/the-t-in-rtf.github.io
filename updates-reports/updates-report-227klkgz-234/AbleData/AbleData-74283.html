Word Prediction is a word prediction program designed for use by individuals with fine motor or upper extremity disabilities and individuals who use one hand on a computer keyboard. This voice output utility program can be used with standard application software. It places an &quot;always on top&quot; window on the computer screen, which can be stretched or shrunk to any size, with automatic adjustment of font size. As the user begins to enter a word, the box displays a list of choices. Words are presented based on &quot;frequency of use,&quot; meaning that words that the user has typed most often in the past appear at the top. As the user continues to type, the list narrows the choices down further. This feature is called &quot;word completion.&quot; To select one of the words from the list, the user presses the corresponding function key (F1 to F9). The program learns new words as the user types (Autolearn) and builds a personalized vocabulary. After the user has finished entering a word, the box will display a list of words that often follow the word just entered, based on the user&#x27;s own vocabulary. The program also includes abbreviation expansion (for example, &quot;gm&quot; may be expanded to &quot;good morning&quot;) and a spell checker. The program automatically speaks as the user types, based on Microsoft Speech. The maximum dictionary size is more than 100,000 words.
