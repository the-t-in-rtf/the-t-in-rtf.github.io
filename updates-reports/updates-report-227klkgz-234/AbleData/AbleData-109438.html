This testing software features computer generated speech, with a choice of voices for test content and software functions; high resolution magnification up to 16 times original size; adjustable background and text colors; on-screen highlighting by word, sentence, and section; synchronized text and speech; and keyboard shortcuts and simplified keystrokes. The software is delivered on a Windows XP Embedded platform that restricts the test taker from being able to save or copy any test content. Test data is uploaded in an encrypted format for recording and documenting the users&#x27; results, or saving the information to a memory device for secure storage. The software takes inaccessible test content and converts it into accessible materials, including XML-based test files, large print, verbal descriptive narratives, tactile images of graphical content, or braille. Test takers receive a sample test to familiarize themselves with the program features and to pre-configure the accessibility options. Upon completion of the setup wizard, the student is issued a profile code that configures the program the same way on the day of the test as it was in the practice sessions.
