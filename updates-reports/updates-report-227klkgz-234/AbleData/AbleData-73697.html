                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Hunter is a voice output game program designed for use by individuals who are blind or have low vision. This arcade-style game involves adventure role-playing. The player&#x27;s character, Hunter Joe, has a mission to reach the ancient land of Bobo and obtain the ancient Bobo tribal statue. On the way to Bobo, the player scores points on 10 levels and fights through the jungle, fishes for food, crosses the valley of tigers, climbs a treacherous mountain, discovers hidden treasure, swings across a waterfall, and flees the ancient warrior Marpoo. The game can be played using the keyboard or a joystick. A configuration program allows the player to remap the joystick buttons. Each level of play has its own set of stereo sound effects. Players can select from three levels of difficulty and play the 10 levels in any sequence. This game program is completely self-voicing, so it can be played without a separate screen reader program. It comes with a Hunter story file and a documentation file. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98 or higher operating system; Microsoft DirectX 8.0 or higher; Microsoft Media Components installed prior to installation of the game.
