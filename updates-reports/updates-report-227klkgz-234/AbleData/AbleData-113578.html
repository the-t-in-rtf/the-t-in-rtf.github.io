Each key is built on an individual Alps mechanical switch, which provides tactile feedback and audible clicks when the key is pressed. The keyboard also allows faster typing speeds, as anti-ghosting circuitry (also called n-key rollover) allows the user to type faster without missing or added letters. The key layout includes Eject and Volume keys. Symbols such as the trademark and copyright symbols and euro, pound, and yen signs are printed right on the Option keys. The user holds down the Option key for the bottom-right characters, or Shift-Option for the top-right characters. Keys are laser etched so labels never wear off. The unit has a USB 2.0 in-keyboard hub with 3 ports for attaching USB peripherals such as MP3 players, keyring hard drives, joysticks, and mice. The keyboard has an Apple layout, but for PC users, a downloadable driver changes the Mac&#x27;s Command and Option keys into Alt and Windows keys. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible or Apple Macintosh computers.
