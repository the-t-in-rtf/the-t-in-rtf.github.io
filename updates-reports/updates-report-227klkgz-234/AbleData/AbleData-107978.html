II On Words &amp;amp; Concepts is a language, vocabulary enhancement, and memory improvement tutorial program designed to exercise short term memory, enhance word knowledge, foster cooperative play, and provide recreational enjoyment for children and adults who have a developmental, physical, or language learning disabilities or autism, or adults with traumatic brain injury and aphasia. This program is a series of educational games that reinforces the lessons of the Words &amp;amp; Concepts II (see separate entry) such as Vocabulary, Categorization, Word Identification by Function, and Word Association. The games use the same vocabulary as Words &amp;amp; Concepts II. Students may play alone or with another player. The object of the game is to find matches based on vocabulary, categorization, word identification by function, or word association. During play, the computer provides auditory instruction and feedback. A menu permits control of the number of cards on the screen, animation, number of players, and the interface method used by each player. Interface options include TouchWindow (see entry), single switch, or keyboard. Scanning speed may be adjusted for single switch users.  COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz)or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB)RAM; a Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD drive.  The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB application RAM; 4x speed CD-ROM.
