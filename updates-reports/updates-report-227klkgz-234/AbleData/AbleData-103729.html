This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use their Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to teach interactively a child to spell. The app is organized into multiple &quot;Learn and Play&quot; sections, each with separate &quot;Learn&quot; and &quot;Play&quot; parts.  Pictures of correctly spelled words are shown one at a time on the screen in the &quot;Learn&quot; part. In the &quot;Play&quot; part, a picture of a correctly spelled word is displayed together with three other incorrectly spelled words. The child is asked to select the correct spelling of the prompted word. Each correct response is rewarded with a cheerful animation. After the child answers the final question, a score screen appears, followed by another animation. Scores are recorded in the app for progress tracking and analysis purposes, and for assignment customization. Available languages include English, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
