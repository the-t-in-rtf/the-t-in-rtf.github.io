Most functions of this OCR program can be activated by pressing a single key. When the user presses the F5 key, the program activates the scanner and recognizes the text. When the scanning is finished, the user presses the F6 key and the program starts reading. This OCR program has full talking menus, so no screen reader is required to navigate through its settings. The system works as well on laptops as it does on desktops, because it does not require use of the external keypad. The program has auto page orientation, so the user can place the document on the scanner at almost any angle and it will still be recognized. In addition to scanned material, the program can open and read existing documents. It supports virtually every type of word processor. The default file format is Microsoft Word. Other features include 5 different voices (Cepstral Voices included); the ability to zoom up to 400 percent and to change font and background colors; ADF support; large print talking menus; and word tracking while reading. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 2000, XP, or Vista operating system; 64 MB (megabytes) RAM (random access memory); 200 MHz (megahertz) or faster processor; 2X or faster CD ROM drive; sound card with speakers; keyboard and mouse; USB scanner.
