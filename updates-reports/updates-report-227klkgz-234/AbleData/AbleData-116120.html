This program enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The user or a parent, teacher, therapist or helper can build scenes and vocabulary by taking photos with their device or importing from the device&#x27;s photo library; record their own voice messages for scenes to make basic requests or share stories; take or import short video files to allocate to scenes; choose and use over 10,000 Widgit symbols to use to support communication; and create hotspots (tagging a scene) on the scene and allocate actions to make an interactive picture. The user can also link scenes to create a sequence of events, support narrative or reinforce cause and effect concepts. To begin using the app, the user can try out the built-in 12 scenes in the scene library and the create his or her own scenes. The user can use a flip book or grid view to find scenes, and use the whole screen as a switch in &quot;touch anywhere&quot; mode, using scanning to highlight the active areas and tapping anywhere to make a choice. The app can be used with a switch via a TherapyBox Switch Box or RJ Cooper interface using one or two switches. Text can be entered for symbol labels in any of the device&#x27;s multilingual keyboards, and messages can be recorded in any language. Scenes can be shared via email, printed for classroom or therapy support, and saved on the device for storage and sharing. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
