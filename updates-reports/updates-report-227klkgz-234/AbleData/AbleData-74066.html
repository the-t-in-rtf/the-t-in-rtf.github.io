It enables individuals who cannot use a mouse or keyboard to operate a computer by pressing a single switch. It works with any standard Macintosh application and offers full mouse and keyboard emulation by means of a scanning mode. With each click on the switch the user selects an action, such as &quot;move the cursor up&quot; or &quot;type B,&quot; from one of several predefined scanning panels. The user can set scanning speed and cycling, mouse speed, and whether the scanning panel becomes partially or fully transparent when no scan is taking place. In addition to switches, the program works with most USB joysticks and gamepads, regular keyboards, and switch interfaces that emulate any of these. The program works with US and several international keyboard layouts. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Mac OS X 10.2 or higher operating system; minimum screen resolution of 800 x 600 pixels.
