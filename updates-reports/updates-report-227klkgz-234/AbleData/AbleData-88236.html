                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Words Around Me is a language tutorial program designed to teach vocabulary words grouped according to theme for pre-kindergarten thourgh sixth grade children with a developmental or physical disability. Words are represented with realistic on-screen photographs, animated graphics and human voices, and introduced by a humorous character who provides plenty of positive reinforcement. A flexible student management system allows teachers to record student progress and customize the progress for individual students. With this program, students will learn new words and their meanings through word recognition, categorization, and word association activities. Each word is represented with at least three different visual representations. Other activities help students understand similarities and differences between objects, and provide opportunities to work with negation, plurals, and prepositions. Vocabulary words are grouped in the following themes: My Collection I, My Collection II, Home Collection, Neighborhood Collection, School Collection, Community Collection, and Key Concepts Collection. There are four vocabulary reinforcement games including Concentration, Hide N&#x27; Seek, Picture Puzzle, and What Belongs? Words can be taught in English or in Spanish. This progam includes built-in scanning for single switch users, and is TouchWindow accessible (see separate entry). COMPATIBILITY: For use with Apple Macintosh or IBM and IBM-compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Windows-based systems, Windows 95/98; 486 or Pentium or better processor, with 33 megahertz (MHz) or faster recommended; hard disk with 5 megabytes (MB) free; 8 MB random access memory (RAM); Super VGA graphics; 640 x 480 pixel display with 256 colors; double-speed (2X) or faster CD-ROM drive; Windows-compatible sound card. For Macintosh systems, Mac 7.5.6 - 9.x 680x0 processor (25 MHz or faster recommended), or PowerPC; 4 MB RAM, 2000K unused, 5 MB for System 7.5 or later, 8 MB highly recommended; CD-ROM drive (double-speed or faster recommended); 13-inch monitor or larger. Printer and Edmark TouchWindow are optional for either system.
