It operates from the top of a computer monitor, laptop computer, or augmentative communication device, and measures the user&#x27;s head movements. The HeadMouse tracks a small disposable target that is placed on the user&#x27;s forehead or glasses. This device provides a wide field-of-view, supports graphics-intensive applications like drawing and computer aided design. HeadMouse Extreme connects to the computer or augmentative communication device through a USB port and operates using standard mouse drivers. The integrated electronic tilt sensor automatically adapts to even the most unusual mounting requirements. When used with an onscreen keyboard, HeadMouse Extreme provides complete hands-free computer control. The unit is equipped with standard 1/8-inch (3.5 millimeter) input for two wired switches and a

                                 POWER: The HeadMouse is powered by the host device, over the USB connection. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers, Macintosh computers, and augmentative communication devices. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: USB port. OPTIONS: Specialized mounting brackets for laptop computers, flat panel displays, and communication devices; sts of 50 and 200 target dots; sip and puff switch and mouth tubes; wireless switch transmitter.
