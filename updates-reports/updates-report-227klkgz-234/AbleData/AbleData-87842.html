Accessibility is available through a keyboard, touch screen, single switch or mouse. There are four verb training activities. The first trains 30 early developing verbs using animated pictures. The second offers training on 108 of the most common irregular verbs in a multiple-choice format in which both the verb forms and the sentences are read aloud to the student. The third activity is available for all of the more than 200 verbs. It trains in a format similar to the second activity, but only the verbs have the speech option. The last activity requires students to spell the various irregular verb forms. In all activities there are teacher choices to set interface, level of difficulty, speech and/or text options, response time, and reinforcement animation. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for the IBM and compatible computers requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB) RAM; a Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD drive. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB application RAM; and a 4x speed CD-ROM.
