                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>HeadMouse Extreme is a wireless head-tracking mouse designed for people who cannot use or have limited use of their hands providing them direct select access to their computer or alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices.
                                The HeadMouse Extreme tracks the natural movements of the user&#x27;s head into directly proportional movements of the mouse pointer on the computer screen, so as the user moves their head the mouse pointer on the screen also moves. Once positioned on the target location, mouse button click operations can be performed via an adaptive switch connected directly to the HeadMouse Extreme via 3.5mm plug connector; or by independent mouse click software that performs the click operation when the user &quot;dwells&quot; on a specific screen location.
                                The computer recognizes the HeadMouse Extreme as a native USB mouse, so no client or special software is required.
                                POWER: USB.
                                COMPATIBILITY: Functions with both Macintosh and PC hardware.
                                SHIPPING WEIGHT: 3 pounds.
                                COLOR: White.
                                WARRANTY/GUARANTEE: As stated by the manufacturer.
