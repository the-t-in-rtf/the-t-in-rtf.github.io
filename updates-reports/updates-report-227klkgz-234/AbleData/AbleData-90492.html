                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>My-T-Mouse is a keyboard interface program designed to allow a mouse or any other pointing device (including track balls, pens, touch screens, joysticks, puffing devices, head mice, InfraRed, switches and digitizer pads) to operate within Windows without, or as an addition to, a keyboard to minimize movement and simplify multi-keystroke actions to a single action for persons with physical disabilities. The software contains 5 different U.S. (including ABCD, DVORAK and QWERTY) and 20 international keyboards, which appear on the screen in a &quot;Heads-Up&quot; format and in nine different sizes. These keyboards may be ideal for non-typists, children, multi-lingual users and companies. Up to 2000 user-defined macro buttons can be created that store keystroke sequences to up to 15 buttons. These macro functions also allow applications to be launched by and/or auto-open Macro Panels associated with that particular application. The program also features a 4-function calculator with memory, and a savable pop-up calculator tape. In all, the program features more than 125 distinct functions, including a magnifier which enhances the viewing area under the cursor. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and IBM-compatible computers with Windows 3.0 or 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, or Windows &#x27;95 installed.
