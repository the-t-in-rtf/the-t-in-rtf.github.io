A parent can use this application (or app) as a screening test to examine his or her child’s development. The app allows the parent to answer a series of &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; questions about the child&#x27;s development at ages 8 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, and 24 to 36 months. ANDDS will give results that indicate whether the child is at risk for developmental delays and conditions such as autism. The parent will not have access to the questions for each age until the child reaches that age. Once the child reaches one of the selected screening ages, the parent can repeat the screening test as many times as he or she would like until the child reaches the next screening age. Sample questions include: &quot;Does the child turn around to look at you when his or her name is called?,&quot; &quot;Does your child imitate you when you clap hands or wave bye-bye?,&quot; &quot;Does your child point at things?,&quot; and &quot;Does your child smile back at you when you smile at them?&quot; Available languages include English, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese and Turkish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later.
