This application (or app) enables a person to type words into an Apple iPhone or iPod Touch in braille rather than using the standard touchscreen keyboard. BrailleTouch features a split keyboard design based on the layout of the braille cell. Dots 1, 2, and 3 are arranged vertically on the left side while dots 4, 5, and 6 are arranged in the same way on the right side of the screen. The current version is based on U.S. English and North American Grade 1 uncontracted braille; and it supports upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and most punctuation. To type with BrailleTouch, the user holds the device with two hands with the screen facing away from him or her in landscape orientation. The first three fingers of the user’s left and right hands fall on the left and right sides of the screen, respectively. Tapping dot 1 with left index finger and the app will speak the letter &quot;A.&quot; BrailleTouch will speak &quot;apostrophe&quot; when the left ring finger types dot 3. The user can tap dot 4 with his or her right index finger and the app will speak the &quot;at-sign,&quot; and tap dot 6 with right ring finger and BrailleTouch will speak &quot;capital.&quot; BrailleTouch is fully compatible with VoiceOver (see separate entry). OPTIONS: Full version ($19.99) is available as an in-app purchase. The full version allows the user to send text messages, tweets, and emails from the touch screen braille keyboard. The user can also copy text entered using braille and paste it into any other app on his or her device. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone (3Gs or higher), iPod Touch (third generation or higher) or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
