                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Creature Chorus Sterling Edition is single switch program designed to introduce the concepts of cause and effect, turn taking, visual tracking, discrete pointing, and use of a single switch for individuals with developmental, physical, or visual disabilities. The program offers nine games for use with a single switch, touch screen, or the space bar. Eight animated characters introduce the concepts of cause and effect, switch use, visual tracking, discrete pointing, and turn taking. Games range from very basic to challenging. An example of the single switch games is &quot;Songfest,&quot; where creatures appear one at a time when a switch or the touch screen is activated. Once all the creatures are present, each switch activation causes them to perform a dance that continues until the next switch activation. A new arrangement is then created and repeated. Another game, &quot;Shrinker,&quot; uses an animated creature and a series of shrinking balls to train pointing to a discrete area on the screen. The program also includes the Sterling Administration System, a powerful set of tools that eases student management, simplifies data analysis, and offers powerful new report-writing options. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Windows version requires a 300 megaHertz (MHz) processor or higher; hard drive with Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM; 40 MB available disk space; a Windows-compatible sound card; and 8x speed CD-ROM drive. The Macintosh version requires a PowerPC with a 300 MHz or higher processor; Mac OS 8.1 or later, including OS X; 128 MB RAM (256 MB RAM for OS X); 40 MB available disk space; 8x speed CD-ROM.
