This program provides highly structured training of early developing nouns. The program trains 50 words in developmental order, but focuses on only five words at a time. Words are presented in isolation or with one other on the screen. The user can choose to work on a black or full-scene background. Optimized Intervention technology begins with a probe test to identify five words the student does not already know. During training, students are presented with two pictures and asked to identify one of them (e.g. &quot;Find the cow.&quot;) The program monitors each student response and then automatically adjusts the training level(one to five) of each word. At the lower levels of training, the Blob reinforces correct answers with amusing antics. At the higher levels of training, a new character named Zot uses expanded language. Zot&#x27;s speech uses the nouns from training with various determiners, plurals, and prepositions. The program also includes the Sterling Administration System, a set of tools for student management, data analysis, and report-writing. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Windows version requires a 300 megaHertz (MHz) processor or higher; hard drive with Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM; 40 MB available disk space; a Windows compatible sound card; and an 8x speed CD-ROM. The Macintosh version requires a PowerPC with a 300 MHz or higher processor; Mac OS 8.1 or later, including OS X; 128 MB RAM (256 MB RAM for OS X); 40 MB available disk space; and an 8x speed CD-ROM drive.
