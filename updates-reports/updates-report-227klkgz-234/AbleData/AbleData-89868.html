Revolving around an animated space adventure where the user must discover stolen crystals, this tutorial program features six mathematical activities designed to provide the participant the opportunity to collect the crystals. These activities, at each of the three space stations, include assembling basic geometric shapes into prescribed patterns based on an ancient Chinese puzzles (tangrams); using a calendar to measure the days, weeks and months of the year; determining the length and weight (all measurements) of a host of household items; and understanding the basic concepts behind fractions is also involved. The user also learns the meaning of equations through simple counting, addition, multiplication and subtraction in addition to recognizing number sequences in a Hangman-like game with numeric clues. COMPATIBILITY: Windows 3.1 or higher--386/25 MHz or better--Windows compatible sound card; Macintosh with a 68030 processor or better. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 4 MB of RAM; 3.5 inch HD discs included.
