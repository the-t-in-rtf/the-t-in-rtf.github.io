Operating on a cause-and-effect principle, the games can be played in four modes: In Cause-and-effect, the child presses the switch, clicks the mouse, or touches the TouchWindow (the switch and TouchWindow are not included) at any time for action; Simple Scan mode seeks to develop beginning switch training skills; Complex Scan mode enables the user to make choices; and Point mode requires the user to make a direct selection. The programs are designed to provide a language rich environment with positive images around multi-cultural characters. Press to Play Zoo invites users to spend a day at the zoo with speedy where pressing the switch causes children to buy ice cream, a baby kangaroo to hop to its mother, a hippo to hide, and more. Press to Play Animals offers funny animated scenes with a rabbit, a monkey, a cat, and a bird. Press to Play Speedy illustrates Speedy&#x27;s day as the young wheelchair user goes fishing, plays with friends, travels on the school bus, plays with a dog, and more. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Macintosh: Macintosh LC or better, System 7 or higher, 256-color monitor, and 8 megabytes (MB) RAM. For IBM and compaitble computers: 386 DX 33 mHz PC or better, Microsoft Windows 3.1 or Windows 95, 256-color monitor, 8 MB RAM, Sound Blaster (see separate entry) or compatible sound card.
