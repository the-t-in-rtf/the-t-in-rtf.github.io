This application (or &quot;app&quot;) is designed to work with the iPad&#x27;s accessibility features. It contains over 250,000 words and phrases, including jargon and proper nouns such as geographic locations and historical persons. Also known as the Ultimate Talking Dictionary, this app reads the definition of a word to the user and provides examples of how to use it in a sentence. It also highlights the word on the screen as it reads and has a built-in complete thesaurus for finding synonyms and antonyms and their corresponding definitions. The &quot;Power Search&quot; feature lets the user look up words with only a partial spelling using interlink technology that enables the user to find related terms and definitions with only a vague concept of a word. The spelling feature provides the user with a list of potential words similar in spelling to the word he or she is typing. Once the user &quot;selects&quot; a word from the list of possible matches, the app reads the word selected, and it will retrieve and display the definition. This program keeps a history of all the words looked up in a particular online session so that a user can easily go back to the previous word just by clicking on the app&#x27;s &quot;Back&quot; button. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
