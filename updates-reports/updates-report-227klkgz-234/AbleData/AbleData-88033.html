Students are motivated to read, to imagine and to write and stage their own stories using scenes and characters in the books and software. First, they read an illustrated story book as they watch it unfold on the computer screen. They can change the screen by moving characters and objects to create new scenes. Children can also write new, animated stories using characters, props and settings from the stories. The Macintosh version has a full-features word processor for multi-paragraph writing projects to allow students to create fully interactive stories. It also supports French and Spanish character sets. There are four packages, each including five story books, one program disk, one back-up disk and a Teacher&#x27;s Guide. The packages are: Just Around The Block; The Bald-Headed Chicken; Rosie, The Counting Rabbit; and K-2 Bundle (includes The Bald-Headed Chicken and Rosie, The Counting Rabbit). Each program is TouchWindow (see separate entry) accessible for students with a physical disability. COMPATIBILITY: Macintosh, Apple, and IBM and compatibles. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Macintoch LC or better; System 6.0.7 or greater; 2 MB RAM (4 MB for System 7.0); 256 color monitor; hard disk. Apple IIe (enhanced), IIc, IIGS; 128K; color monitor; single disk drive. IBM or compatible; 640K; single 3.5 inch disk drive; EGA, VGA or MCGA and color monitor; mouse.  Optional for all systems: TouchWindow, printer.
