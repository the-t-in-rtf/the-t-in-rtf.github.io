                    This page summarises a recent change to a vendor record associated with an entry in the unified listing.
                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

The nerve regions that receives signals from the roof the mouth/soft palate that control the ability to sniff are often unaffected by paralytic injuries and disorders. The scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, devised a new sniff controller that uses tubes placed up the nose to measure sniff-triggered changes in nasal air pressure. Individuals with severe disabilities were able to navigate an electric wheelchair, control a mouse cursor, play simple computer games, utilize an interface to write email and surf the Internet. Individuals with Locked-in Syndrome were able to write text with the device as well. While promising, the sniff modality results vary based on the abilities of the patient physically and mentally to learn to use the device; however, the device may still be useful to many individuals  and prove much simpler to implement than techniques which try to control external objects by direct brain activity or brain-computer interface.
