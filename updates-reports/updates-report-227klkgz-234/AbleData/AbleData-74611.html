It is a user-friendly system for reading any electronic text on the computer. The reading material can be taken from a disk, downloaded from the web, scanned into the computer, or typed in by the user. In &quot;text mode&quot; the program plays through the text without speaking it. The user can speak the words as they appear, and when there is a difficult word, the user can click on the word to hear it spoken. The user can thus practice reading without assistance. In &quot;speech mode,&quot; this program displays text in large letters across the middle of the computer screen, one word at a time, while speaking the words using speech synthesis. In either mode, the user can play the text, pause, and step backwards and forwards to a word, sentence, paragraph, or section. The program can be controlled using just cursor keys and the mouse, or it can be operated entirely through the keyboard for anyone who cannot use a mouse or see the mouse pointer. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000 Pro, and XP Home.
