The Learning Assessment Programs were written to help identify the student or employee’s ability to handle job-specific math, communication, science, and problem-solving skills related to the workplace. The management system starts with a screening of interests and assigns activities for the user based on the scored results. The system then delivers all assigned job-specific and academic skills assessments, scores the assessments, and correlates results to the user’s state content standards. The user’s data are tracked, scored, benchmarked, stored and printed in the system. The programs allow users to experience entry, mid, and advanced level job activities. They also include an audio option for users with limited reading skills. Each career area contains three LAPs. Career areas include: automotive technology, biotechnology, commercial fishing, day care worker, electronics, fast foods worker, graphic design, health care, medical/dental assistant, and nursing. Each LAP can create a prescription for learning for transition Individual Education Programs (IEPs) that correlates to standards in each state and connects transition programs to NCLB legislation. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers with a CD/DVD-ROM drive, a sound card and speakers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM and compatible computers, Windows XP, Vista, or 7 operating system; 1 gigahertz (GHz) or greater Pentium or AMD processor; 128 megabytes (MB) or greater RAM. For Macintosh computers, Mac OS X 10.4 or greater; PowerPC G4 or greater, or Intel processor; 128 MB or greater RAM.
