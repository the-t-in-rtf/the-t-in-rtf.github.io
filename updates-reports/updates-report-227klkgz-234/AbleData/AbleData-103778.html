This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to teach a child to learn to spell colors and shapes interactively. It is part of the iLearnNEarn (iLNE) series of apps based on an evidence-based autism intervention model. The app is organized into multiple “Learn and Play” sections. Each section has pictures as visual prompts, and includes separate “Learn” and “Play” parts. The “Learn” part shows how each word is spelled. In the “Play” part, the child is asked to select each letter from a group of letters at the top of the screen and place them in the boxes at the bottom in correct order to match a word spoken by the app. Clues are shown or hidden depending on the difficulty level of each word. The app moves to the next word when the current word is spelled correctly. The child is rewarded with a cheerful animation for each correct response. After the child answers the final question, a score screen appears. A transition animation is shown between each section. Available languages include English, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
