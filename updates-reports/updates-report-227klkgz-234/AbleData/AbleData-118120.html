It is designed to be used as an augmentative and alternative communication device by individuals who have communication or speech disabilities. The PolyAndro-10 is an adapted Google Nexus 10 tablet computer with 16 or 32 gigabytes (GB) of memory, a Mali T604 quad-core processor with 2 GB RAM and Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean). The Nexus tablet has a 10-inch 2560 x 1600 WQXGA True RGB touch screen display with scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla glass. It also has an internal microphone, a micro USB port and an earphone jack. The tablet comes equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth and NFC (Android Beam) capabilities. It comes with a neck strap, a Bluetooth speaker, and a carrying case with a pouch for the speaker. Included with this tablet is the Persona for Android app, a text-to-speech app that is only available with the PolyAndro-7 and PolyAndro-10. When the user types on the tablet&#x27;s onscreen keyboard, the tablet will speak the typed word, phrase or sentence aloud. The listener can also see what the user is typing on the tablet’s forward facing display. The Persona for Android offers word completion and prediction, the ability to store phrases and text files for rapid recall, on-screen output volume adjustment, and multiple languages with several voice options for each language. Google text-to-speech is standard, but high-quality speech can be downloaded directly from various synthesizer providers using the Google Play store.<img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="End inserted content."/></ins>
