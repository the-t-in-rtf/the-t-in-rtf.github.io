                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>MathPad is a math tutorial program designed for use by individuals wih physical, learning, or visual disabilities. This program enables students to solve basic arithmetic problems--addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division--on the computer in the same way they would solve them using a pencil and paper. MathPad displays the problems in the appropriate vertical format, displays the student&#x27;s work, and requires student to decide when to regroup or when to show a remainder. Accessible with a mouse, a standard keyboard, or IntelliKeys (see separate entry), the program enables users to select from 300 sample problems or to load customized problem files created in a word processor. Standard access features include multiple font sizes and colors, high contrast settings for students with visual disabilities, auditory feedback as the program reads problems and/or rows of numbers, and navigational assistance as the cursor is automatically moved to the next place in the problem. The program also checks problems, placing a check mark beside correctly solved problems and a dash beside incorrectly solved problems in the problem list. Problems may also be printed individually or one page at a time; a check is printed beside correct answers and an &quot;X&quot; is placed beside incorrect answers. A separate file can be set up for each student and the program keeps a portfolio of each student&#x27;s work. The set includes the MathPad software, two IntelliKeys overlays, and 300 bonus problems. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh Systems. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Runs on any Macintosh System with System 7 or higher, 4 megabytes (MB) RAM, and a 14-inch or larger monitor. WARRANTY: 60-day unconditional money back guarantee with return merchandise authorization  from the manufacturer.
