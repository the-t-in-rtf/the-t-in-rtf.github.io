This alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system is a Windows 7 tablet comes preloaded with Endeavor Talker Pro Software (see separate entry), allowing the user to communicate with others by touching graphical buttons on the tablet&#x27;s screen to speak words or compose sentences. The device features over 1000 pre-built buttons for common words and phrases; templates in the button library; two Cepstral voices; special-purpose buttons for accessing files and libraries; and single-click access to any computer program, media, or web content. Drag-and-drop page layouts can be configured to have as few as one large communication button or as many as 50 buttons on a page. The user can create their personalized page layouts with buttons and images from the included SymbolStix image library, create new Talker buttons by dragging images directly from Google Images or from his or her own image library, and change the color of any page or add any wallpaper to the page background. The user can also record their own words or phrases to be spoken using digitized speech, or use text-to-speech to generate speech. Voice speed is adjustable, and buttons can be set to speak immediately when a button is touched or after the user has composed a phrase or sentence. The user’s communication patterns can be analyzed with CSV file logging of all button presses. Other features include Web Trek customizable browser, Visual Media Player, picture- and audio-based Endeavor Email, Visual Impact Task Prompting (step-by-step multimedia instructions for any task), and AIMS Task Builder (to create custom multimedia instructions for any task). OPTION: Endeavor Talker SmartLife Service.
