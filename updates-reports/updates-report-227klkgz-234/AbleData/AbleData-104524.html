This unit has more than 150 magnification levels from 3.1x (22-inch monitor) or 3.4x (24-inch monitor) to 95x. The magnification increases in 0.1x increments from 3.1x to 10x (for example: 3.1x, 3.2x, 3.3x etc.), and in 1x increments from 11x to 95x. The user can control the level of magnification and how wide of a view is displayed on the screen. For many users, the high resolution makes text readable at a lower magnification, due to its sharper image, allowing them to view a wider field of text with more letters or words displayed across the line, requiring less movement of the X/Y reading table. For photos, the lower magnification level allows a wider field of view, so the natural color image shows more definition and detail. The high definition monitor can move vertically, tilt forward and back and swivel left and right to optimize the viewing angle. &quot;Power,&quot; &quot;Zoom&quot;, and &quot;Mode&quot; buttons are located on the front panel under the screen. The two large, ergonomic &quot;Zoom&quot; buttons control magnification. Pushing the upper button increases the magnification, and to lower button decreases the magnification. The &quot;Mode&quot; buttons (left and right arrow button) select or change the image mode. Image modes  color, enhanced reverse image (white letters on a black background), enhanced black and white, and normal black and white. In addition, the user can select four custom display modes by choosing from a palette of 28 text and background combinations, such as yellow text on black. The user can set horizontal or vertical Line Markers to help guide reading across a row of text or separate columns of a table or spreadsheet, or create a horizontal or vertical window view by adjusting the Window mode button. The user can also plug in a DVI-D cable to connect the unit to a personal computer and then toggle back and forth to switch between a full screen view of the video magnifier image or the full screen view of the computer display. Users have the option to select between Picture Mode, in which all text, photos, pictures, graphs, and similar images are displayed in geometric proportion, or Text Mode, in which the text and spacing between letters are slightly expanded making it visually more comfortable for some users. POWER: Uses a household outlet 100/240 volt 50/60 hertz. DIMENSIONS: 20.8 x 21.6 x 20.1 inches; 22- or 24-inch LCD monitor. WEIGHT: 40 pounds. WARRANTY/GUARANTEE: 2 year manufacturer warranty.
