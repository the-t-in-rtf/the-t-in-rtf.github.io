This program teaches keyboarding skills through a visually- and audibly-cued, split screen, alphabetical approach that has been tested to meet the needs of children and adults with various learning style needs. There are three editions available - Students with Learning Disabilities; Students with Dyslexia; and Students with Visual Disabilities. Each edition includes a complete set of lesson plans and instructional goals will enable the teacher to fulfill and adhere to the mandates of each student&#x27;s Individualized Education Plan (I.E.P.). As the user types the lesson, the top half of the screen is synchronized with flashing keys to the student&#x27;s keystroke on a virtual keyboard on bottom screen. Upon successful completion of each lesson, supplemental graded exercises are supplied for reinforcement of acquired keyboarding skills. A graded spelling practice quiz, and 1-, 3-, and 5-minute speed tests that automatically time and grade the user are included. A printed record of all exercises including name, date, and grade will provide a teacher and parents with an accurate and progressive record of the user&#x27;s achievement. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM or compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Microsoft Windows NT, 98, 2000, ME, XP or Vista; 512 megabytes (MB) memory; 54 MB of hard drive space; CD-ROM drive; sound card.
