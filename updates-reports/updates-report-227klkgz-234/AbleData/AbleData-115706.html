This program enables children and adults with learning disabilities to independently write comprehensible, error-free text in English. The kinds of spelling mistakes commonly generated by people with dyslexia are corrected automatically based on context and phonetic word similarity. The program corrects phonetic spelling mistakes, unusual spelling mistakes, split/merged words, consecutive nouns, and missing spaces. The program also identifies and automatically corrects misused words based on the context of the entire sentence. It detects and corrects grammatical mistakes in categories such as verb tenses, prepositions, and adjective/adverb usage. Entire sentences are corrected in a single click, so the user does not need to select the spelling or grammar correction from a list of alternatives or confirm the correction for each word. A list of alternatives is provided for each correction, and the user can click any grammar or spelling correction to get explanations for the correction, including dictionary definitions and sample expressions for the original word the user used and for the correction and for any alternative correction. An audio option reads aloud text files, emails and websites in a high quality human voice, and can also provide speech feedback on written English text so that users with dyslexia and other learning disabilities can hear how their work sounds when read aloud. The program highlights the current word as it is read, and the user can adjust the reading speed and select a male or female voice with a U.S. or UK accent. Display settings are adjustable, including colors, font size, font type, and line spacing. The program provides personalized reports identifying the user&#x27;s most frequent errors and tracking improvement over time. COMPATIBILITY: For use on PC computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Microsoft Windows XP with SP2 or higher, Vista, or Windows 7 operating system; Internet connection with Internet Explorer.
