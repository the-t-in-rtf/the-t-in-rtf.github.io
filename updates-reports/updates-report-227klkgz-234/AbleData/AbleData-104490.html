                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Time Timer is a timer program designed for use by parents and teachers working with children with autism or other developmental or cognitive disabilities and youth and adults who have disabilities that affect their ability to keep track of time. This application (or app) allows a person to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or Android device to show elapsed time and to alert the person when a selected period of time expires. Time Timer displays time as a red disk which gets smaller as time elapses. This app can be operated in a Quick Start mode for which the user taps &quot;Quick Start,&quot; touches the number of minutes needed, and presses &quot;Play!&quot;. The red disk counts down to 0 and notifies the user when time is up even if the user has left the app. The user can also tap the disk at any time to see a numerical readout of how much time is left. The user can also create new timers in one of three visual modes: 60-minute mode (showing time as a portion of 60 minutes), custom mode (showing any amount of time needed), or clock mode (see what time it will be when time is up). The app can run up to four of these custom timers at the same time. Other features include adding or editing one timer while others keep counting down and an &quot;Awake Mode&quot; that prevents the host device from going into sleep mode when a timer is running. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or Android device. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later; Android 3.0 or later.
