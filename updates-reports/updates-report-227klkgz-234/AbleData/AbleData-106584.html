There are between 1 and 10 choice buttons with pictures or text that can be displayed on a game board at a time. A game can have up to 1,000 choice buttons associated with it. A choice button is pressed by using switches, a touch window, the computer keyboard, or a mouse click. When a choice button is pressed, a reward is presented as a reward picture, reward text, music file, sound effect, or movie clip. Once a choice button is pressed and a reward is given, the choice button disappears. This is to prevent the student from pressing the same choice button repeatedly. When all of the choice buttons are pressed, a new set of choice buttons is presented. 
                                Pick &amp;amp; Choose comes with many pre-made games (including quizzes) and an extensive library of choice buttons, Pick &amp;amp; Choose also allows you to create new games by giving you the ability to create your own choice buttons with your own graphics and sounds. Pick &amp;amp; Choose also has an import and export feature to give you the ability to copy your games and choice buttons to other computers with Pick &amp;amp; Choose installed on them. 
                                There are also a variety of game board colors and choice button colors to customize your game. It also allows you to place the choice buttons horizontally or vertically on any side of the board. Choice buttons can dynamically be made larger or smaller during a game by pressing the &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; keys. This feature is useful for touch window users to practice fine motor skills. Pick &amp;amp; Choose sizes all pictures automatically for you. Data collection is automatically saved and can be viewed in a spreadsheet or text format. With Pick &amp;amp; Choose, you can create the following types of games in minutes:
