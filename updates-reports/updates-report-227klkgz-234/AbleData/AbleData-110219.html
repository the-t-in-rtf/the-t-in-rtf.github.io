Activities are presented through a series of modules designed to facilitate communication between users and caregivers. Modules include Emotions, Spatial Relationships, Choice Restaurant, Lost Keys, and Draw. The modules present real life scenarios in a way that is age-appropriate for adults. With respect for individuality, the modules are designed to stimulate users and provide them with a variety of meaningful learning experiences. Users are presented with both abstract and concrete concepts in a way that helps them develop listening and comprehension skills, requires them to make choices, and provides them with problems to solve. The program engages users and caregivers by portraying topics and practical real life scenarios that they can use and discuss. It provides non-judgmental feedback to users, does not get impatient with repetition, and treats everyone the same. The Draw module allows the user to practice mouse control while stimulating creativity. It allows the user to manipulate an on-screen pen and line using a mouse or mouse emulator.
