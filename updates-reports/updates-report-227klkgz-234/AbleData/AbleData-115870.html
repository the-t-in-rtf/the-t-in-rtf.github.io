The program allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to learn vocabulary, reading, phonics, language skills and code breaking. The Word Bop action takes place on an arcade-like playing field. The child fires the jolly red popper cannon as objects float slowly by by tapping on the screen. Pop an object and it changes into its word and the device speaks the word at the same time. If the child &quot;pops&quot; the word, it changes back into the object, the device speaks the word again, and the object disappears. If the user clears all the objects, he or she moves to the next round. The program comes with more than 100 words and four levels of difficulty. Each level has multiple rounds to clear. Rewards and penalties appear at the top of the screen, and high scores are stored in the program. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
