This application provides users with information about concussions, a self-assessment instrument for symptoms and their severity, tools to help users build resilience and manage symptoms, as well as recommendations for community-based resources and support. Users can customize tools based on their references and can integrate their own contacts, photos, and music. This app can be used by itself, but it may be more effective in combination with treatment by a healthcare professional. Concussion Coach was created by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affair’s Rehabilitation and Prosthetic Services, the National Center for PTSD and Department of Defense’s National Center for Telehealth &amp;amp; Technology. Downloadable on iTunes.
