This application (or app) allows a parent to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to help prepare a child for going to the dentist. The child will see what is likely to happen and hear some of the typical sounds that they would hear during the visit through stories told through a QBook, an interactive digital book. This book tells the story of seeing the dentist in a sequence of 12 pages with pictures and text and can be personalized for a particular child. The child can also color in the book and record his or her own voice or a parent&#x27;s voice. The Swipe-to-Read feature allows the child to hear and playback the story&#x27;s words at his or her own pace. Other features include Touch-to-Hear which speaks individual words and Touch-to-Spell which speaks the letters that spell each and every word. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.1.2 or later.
