Program is on cartridge that plugs into the expansion port at the back of the computer. Once plugged in, it becomes instantly activated when computer is turned on. When keys are pressed, the characters on monitor are large and of high contrast. Actual size of characters depends upon the monitor being used, the larger the monitor, the larger the size. With regular monitor, characters are 1 inch high, 3/4 inch wide with 3/4 inch spacing between the characters. White on black background. Functions like ordinary word-processor. Text is stored in memory and can be reviewed on screen. One can make corrections at any time, by inserting and deleting. Can then be printed out where it will be printed with automatic word-wrap between margins that the user sets. If user has disk or tape drive, it can be stored or read from disk or tape. A sighted person can use an ordinary word- processor to prepare text and then store it as a sequential file. This program can read and display the text continuously or one word at a time. Now available on 5 1/4 inch floppy disk, but recommends cartridge for those with more severe impairments.
