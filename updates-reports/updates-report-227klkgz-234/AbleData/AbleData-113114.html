                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Camera Mouse is a mouse emulator program designed for use by individuals with severe physical or neurological disabilities, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, or upper extremity amputation. This program allows the user to control the mouse pointer on a computer through head movement. To use the software, a USB video camera (webcam) is connected to the computer, with the camera placed on the monitor and focused at the user. The user&#x27;s moving image appears in the Camera Mouse window. A mouse click over one of the user&#x27;s facial features, such as the inside edge of an eyebrow or eye or the area between the nose and the mouth, selects that feature for tracking. A small green square appears on the user&#x27;s image over the feature being tracked, and the square moves with the user&#x27;s head movements. The program takes over control of the mouse pointer on the screen after four seconds, or with the press the Scroll Lock key or the Control key. As the user&#x27;s head moves the mouse pointer moves accordingly. Control returns to the physical mouse if it is moved or if the Scroll Lock key or Control key are pressed. Clicking is done using dwell time, by holding the mouse pointer within a small area of the screen for a second or two. Alternatively, clicking can be done using the mouse button or a switch. Settings can be adjusted by clicking on a button at the bottom of the window. COMPATIBILTIY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP or Vista operating system; standard USB video camera.
