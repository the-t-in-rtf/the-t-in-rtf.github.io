The DoubleTalk PC includes four types of speech synthesizers. This card does not effect the speed of the application in use, converts English or Spanish text to speech, and can play back several types of digitized speech. The device offers 11 programmable modes and user-controlled parameters such as selectable voices, translation modes, index markers, and others. An external speaker is included. DoubleTalk LT offers the same basic features as the DoubleTalk PC, but relies on an external connection to the computer and an alternating current (AC) adaptor is included instead of an external speaker. COMPATIBILITY: Double Talk PC installs in any computer designed to accommodate an eight-bit, half-length card. DoubleTalk LT is compatible with Macintosh computers, IBM and compatible PCs and notebooks, and Echo synthesizers (see separate entry). WARRANTY: Two-year warranty.
