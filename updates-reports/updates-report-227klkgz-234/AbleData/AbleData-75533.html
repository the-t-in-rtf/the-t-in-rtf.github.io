The program offers full multimedia support, permitting drag-and-drop entry of photographs, drawings, video, and audio that stay where they are placed. Text and graphics can be rotated simply by dragging. A large library of clip art is included. The built-in voice engine speaks text as it is typed and the built-in spell checker provides speech feedback as well as visual cues. This program supports most common file formats, making it compatible with digital cameras and scanners. Drawing tools include rectangles, ellipses, straight lines, and freehand. An E-mail link permits documents and snapshots to be sent to an outbox. Files can be saved as web pages in hyper text mark-up language (HTML) and viewed through any browser. The program also includes a library of lesson plans, student activities, teacher resources, plus a copy of Tool Factory Administrator. The program is configurable for a range of ages and learning abilities. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on IBM and compatible computers and Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM version requires a Pentium or better processor; CD-ROM drive; Windows 95, 98, 2000, or XP; 16-bit 800 x 600 color graphics; and 32 megabytes (MB) RAM. The Macintosh version requires Power PC, Operating System 8.0, CD-ROM drive, 800 x 600 color monitor, and 24 MB RAM.
