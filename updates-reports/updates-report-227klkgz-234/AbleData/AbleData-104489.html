This application (or app) allows the user to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to add symbols and speech to text. The program automatically adds symbols to text as the user types, and symbols can be set to appear above or below words. Documents are read with a text-to-speech voice while text is highlighted word by word. Documents created in SymbolSupport can also be read with the SymbolSupport Viewer app. SymbolSupport comes with Slater Literacy Support Pictures and the GoTalk Image Library which include over 6,000 symbols. The app also allows the user to create custom symbols with photos from the device&#x27;s camera or by using the built-in Internet image search function. These custom symbols are saved for future use and given preference when the associated word is typed again. The user can create as many documents as he or she would like. The user can also add symbols to existing written material by copying and pasting the text into SymbolSupport. Documents created using the app can be edited on different devices though iCloud. The app can connect with 15 devices simultaneously via Wi-Fi for document transfer. Symbolized documents can be printed with AirPrint or emailed as images or PDFs. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 6.0 or later.
