This stand-alone device can be used by a person that can operate one or two switches. The user plugs a switch-adapted remote control or device that he or she wishes to control into the Scan-5&#x27;s 9-pin port. The Scan-5 scans both visually and audibly (the user records his or her voice for each function) through five functions. There are two types of &quot;scanning&quot; - Auto and Step. In the Auto mode, the user activates the switch to start the scan. The first button lights up and speaks and waits for a set period of time for the user to activate the switch. If the user does not activate the switch, the next button lights up and is announced. This process continues through the last button. The scan stops if no selection is made, and the user can activate the switch to start again. A Step Scan requires two switches. The second switch &quot;steps&quot; through the choices so each time that the user presses the switch, the Scan-5 lights up and speaks the next button. The original switch functions as the selected switch so when the desired button is lit up, the user activates this switch and the Scan-5 &quot;presses&quot; that button to perform the desired function. POWER: The Scan-5 uses a rechargeable battery that can be recharged from a computer via the included cable or with the included charger.
