By providing large print and voice output options directly on a web site, this program enables visitors with low vision to access sites without their own assistive access features. This program is installed as a usability tool on a web site and started by users who visit the site. The user clicks the utility link to download, and the necessary program components are set up automatically. The program allows the user to enlarge text and characters and change the background color. It reads text aloud with adjustable speed and volume. The user points the mouse to select a sentence for reading. The program also assigns sound effects to events such as download completion. Additional language components can be downloaded when users navigate to a page displayed in a new language, including English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Korean, Japanese, or Chinese. The program displays a control panel with buttons that are arranged for convenient use. It has a full screen mode that keeps the same, fixed layout of operation buttons and content windows at all times. The program automatically checks for updates whenever the user revisits a web site. If the user&#x27;s version is older than the version being run on the site, the program automatically downloads the new version to keep that user up-to-date. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Server requirements are IBM HTTP Server, Apache or equivalent; ability to store download files of approximately 10 megabytes (MB) for basic language support and an additional 5 MB for each additional language; 100 MB of free hard disk space; Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Linux, or equivalent operating system. For end users, requirements are a 500 megaHertz (MHz) processor; 128 MB memory; 500 MB hard disk drive; XGA (1024x768 pixel) display with 65,536 colors; Windows 2000 Professional, XP, or Vista operating system; Internet broadband connection of 512 kilobytes per second or higher; Internet Explorer version 5.5 or higher; and a 16-bit sound card.
