The system includes STISIM Drive Software; 1 (model M100-OT) driver display screen or 3 (M100WS-OT) driver display screens; 1 Dell computer work station (M100-OT) or 3 Dell work stations (M100WS-OT) with Microsoft Windows and high performance nVIDIA graphics card; 1 operator display screen; and USB-based commercial driving controls (steering wheel and gas and brake pedals). The software includes over 60 pre-designed scenarios from which the OT can select an applicable example beneficial to the intended evaluation procedure. The scenarios are divided into the following procedural categories: Orientation; Warm-Up Drives; Vehicle Control and Reaction Time; Car Following and Divided Attention; Memory, Planning and Navigation; Passing, Gap Judgments and Merging; Hazard Perception; and Longer Complete Drives. Each of these categories is sub-divided into Easy, Moderate, and Difficult scenario versions. The OT can modify the user interface to add or delete driving situations so the simulation is more appropriate to their patient populations. The single screen display (model M100-OT) provides the user with a 60-degree field of view, and the 3-screen display (M100WS-OT) provides a 135-degree field of view. The operator display shows a real time summary of driving data during each simulation. The software generates customized reports that present metrics and data specific to the simulated drive just completed. The OT can create a database that tracks the treatment routine, driving results (scenario results), and rehabilitation progress for each selected patient. Results can be printed for filing or saved in a PDF file. On-site installation and training as well as one year of technical support are included. OPTIONS: Manual transmission and projector. WARRANTY: One-year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.
