This program is multisubject with five different ctivities; multisensory, encouraging children&#x27;s senses both on and off the computer; and multilevel with four level changes. It helps children to build preschool skills with letters, numbers, shapes, and patterns through interactive play. The audio combined with graphics and animation encourages children to dance and sing, jump and stretch to promote large motor skills activities. A song button brings to life an original song for each of the five activities and they can also be played on a regular CD player. Activities include the Counting Club, which introduces counting, number recognition, and simple math; ABC Dinner which teaches matching letters, recognizing letters and sounds, and identifying first letter sounds; Shape Shack which introduces fundamentals to reading, science and thinking through sorting and classification; and Pattern Parade which encourages children to identify and create patterns based on color, size and sound. There are four challenging levels - discover, build, apply and play - for each activity with each level focussing on developing key concepts. COMPATIBILITY: IBM compatible or Macintosh with a double speed CD-ROM drive. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows version requires a 386 DX/33 Mhz processor or better; 4 MB RAM; a hard disk; a 256-color SGVA monitor; a Windows compatible sound card; DOS version 5.0 or higher and Windows version 3.1 or higher (including Windows 95). The Macintosh version requires a 68030 processor or better; 4 MB RAM; a hard disk; a 256 color monitor and System 7.0.1 or Higher.
