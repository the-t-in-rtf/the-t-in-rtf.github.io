About the size of a deck of cards, this projection device uses laser projection and motion detection technology to turn any table or other flat surface into a virtual keyboard or multi-touch mouse. Designed for use with laptop computers, mobile phones, and tablet computers supporting standard Bluetooth HID keyboards, the projected keyboard appears to the connected device as a standard keyboard or touchpad, communicating via USB for wired use or Bluetooth for wireless use. The unit projects a condensed QWERTY layout and detects movement just above the surface of each projected key. Devices with automatic keystroke correction can improve accuracy. Power off/on the Magic Cube to switch between wired use with a USB connection and wireless when a USB connection is not available. No drivers are needed. The unit runs for up to two hours of continuous typing when operating in wireless mode. A manual and quick start guide with typing tips is included. In mouse mode, the device projects a standard two-finger multi-touch mouse pad; the mouse moder requires a computer running Windows 7 or higher.  POWER: Uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (included) that charges when connected via a USB 2.0 cable (included). COMPATIBILITY: For use with Windows XP SP2 or higher, Vista, Windows 7 (required for multi-touch mouse), Mac OS 10.4+, iOS 4.3.5+ (iPhone 3GS and later, iPod Touch 2nd generation and later, and all versions of iPad), Linux, and others supporting standard Bluetooth HID keyboards. Android 2.0+ compatibility is limited to phones and devices that include Bluetooth keyboard support. DIMENSIONS:  1.1 x 1.5 x 2.9 inches. WEIGHT: 10.4 ounces.
