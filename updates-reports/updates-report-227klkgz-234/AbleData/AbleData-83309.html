The student uses a keyboard, joystick or TouchWindow (see separate entry) to make selections. The student must be able to point, say or sign back a response, and have enough receptive language to understand the cues. The program teaches 350 words chosen from the Dolch Word List and basal readers, as well as &quot;-s,&quot; &quot;-ed,&quot; and &quot;-ing&quot; endings, capitalization, and punctuation. Lessons move from pre-reading matching to word recognition, matching words to pictures, matching phrases to pictures, and short illustrated stories. The program contains 572 lessons in five formats and additional practice, review, and post-test activities. A resource on disk allows the teacher to maintain data on 10 students at one time. Use of an Echo speech synthesizer is required if the teacher wishes to provide verbal cues and reinforcement that differs to suit student response. Other features include 130 stories, choice of standard interface (for visual interest) or simple interface (for easily distracted students), high quality audio cues and reinforcement, single switch scanning, teacher guide, printable signing manual with signing illustrations and instruction, and printable flash cards. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM compatible computers, Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP or later operating system; Pentium 133 megahertz (MHz) or Pentium 90 or greater processor depending on stand-alone or network installing; 32 megabytes (MB) or 64 MB or greater RAM.
