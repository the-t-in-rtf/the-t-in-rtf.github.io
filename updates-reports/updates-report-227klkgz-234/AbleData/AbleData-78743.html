This program uses advanced technology to expand a few keystrokes to full word, phrases, or sentences by automatically comparing three or four keystrokes in a particular order to words or phrases in the dictionary-like glossaries. The program then offers the user a choice of all words and phrases meeting the criteria. Keystrokes are saved with phrases using initial letters. For example, &quot;iac&quot; expands to &quot;in any case.&quot; For users with a substantial number of saved electronic documents, glossaries are compiled from existing documents, creating personalized lists. For users without an extensive collection of documents, other glossaries are available and are organized by special needs, such as disability-specific, school subject-specific, law practice-specific, etc. Each user can also organize glossaries, compiled automatically by the program for different tasks, such as addreeses, E-mail, work, medical or general correspondence, etc. Glossaries can be combined or used simultaneously. This program can be used with most word processing and E-mail applications, or it can be used independently with its built-in text editor. This program enables downloading of glossaries from the manufacturer&#x27;s website, importing of glossaries from other programs, and exchanging of glossaries over the Internet via E-mail. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Personal computer (PC) with Intel 486 or Pentium compatible processor; Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, or NT; four megabytes (MB) RAM; and three MB hard drive space.
