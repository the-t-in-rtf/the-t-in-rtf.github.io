Multimedia Speech System is an augmentative communicaton program designed to provide scanning, direct selection, or switch activated access to sound and voice output or a number of other computer software programs. The system components include the Gus! Talking Keyboard, Gus Easy Talk speech synthesizer, Gus Speak Clipboard, Gus Talking Calculator, Gus symbol set, and Gus mouse/switch interface. KEYBOARD: The on-screen keyboard is combined with a clear synthetic voice and features adjustable speed, volume, and pitch. An Exception Dictionary is included. When used with Windows for Pen Computing, the program offers handwriting recognition, handwriting-to-speech, and gesture-to-speech features. The keyboard display is shown at the bottom of the computer screen, with a text display area above it. In addition to a full keyboard layout, buttons include Press to Speak, Clear Display, Import Text, Instant Recital of date and time, and Export Text. SPEECH SYSTEM: This provides CD-quality words, sentences, sound effects, and music. Any recordable voice, regardless of age, sex, language, or dialect may be reproduced. Digital (recorded with the built-in Microsoft Sound Recorder program), synthesized (spontaneous), and pre-planned (clipboard) speech are possible. SYMBOLS: The user may choose from two to 72 symbol buttons per page, with unlimited layers. Buttons may be customized with a few selections, or created with the built-in Microsoft Paintbrush drawing program of any PC-compatible symbol set, such as the Mayer-Johnson symbols. MOUSE/SWITCH: This device (included) may be used as a standard mouse, a switch and/or a switch interface at the same time. It has two sockets for attaching industry standard switches for scanning selections. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM or IBM-compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95, 98, XP or 2000 operating system.
