The program allows educators, instructional system designers, and software designers to add animated SigningAvatar characters to web page, CD-ROM, DVD, and kiosk content in order to communicate through sign language. Signed English translations are generated automatically by the program, and authors who know American Sign Language (ASL) can create content that incorporates the signs, facial expressions, mouthing, and eye gaze that are integral to communicating in ASL. A cast of three-dimensional animated characters perform the designer&#x27;s script and sign the text. The program can create web page HTML, script, or video output. In each program utilizing SigningAvatar characters, the designer can select an ôappropriateö character for the environment from among characters of different age groups and ethnic backgrounds, plus a signing reptile. The authoring program includes a library of 2,000 signs and facial expressions, and 10,000 English words and signed English equivalents. A menu displays facial expression as well as a description of when the expression is appropriate in ASL grammar. Non-linear editing tools allow the author to move, delete, edit, insert, and replace scripted information independently. Five concurrent behaviors (sign, co-sign, expression, gaze, and mouthing) can be synchronized to work together for natural, lifelike character interaction. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium-compatible 450 megahertz (MHz) processor, 600 MHz+ recommended; 128 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), 256 MB recommended; 3D Accelerated Graphics Card with at least 8 MB memory, AGP interface preferred; Windows 98SE, Me, 2000, or XP operating system, or Windows NT with Service Pack 6; Internet Explorer 5 or higher; sound card.
