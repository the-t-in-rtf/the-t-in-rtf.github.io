This switch-activated game plays an object&#x27;s sound when the object is selected by the spinner. The spinner is activated by step scanning, timed scanning, a single switch press, a mouse click, or touch-screen. Once the picture is selected and the sound is played, a new picture will take its place. Wheel of Sounds gives the user the capability of setting the field of pictures to display two, three, or four pictures at a time, creating customized games by selecting only certain pictures to include in a game.  Users can also optionally add their own pictures and sounds. Included with the program are separate games for pictures of various objects, a game for letters, a game for colors, and a game for numbers. Auditory scanning is built into the program. Wheel of Sounds can also be used as a matching activity. When &quot;Matching&quot; is turned on, one of the pictures in the field of pictures is copied to the center of the spinner. The user must then select the picture that matches the one in the center of the spinner. If the picture chosen does not match, a voice will tell the user that the picture does not match and the sound associated with the picture is not played. If the picture matches, the computer will say &quot;very good&quot; and will play the sound associated with the picture. Statistics on the percentages of correct and incorrect matches can be saved if desired to monitor the user&#x27;s progress. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  Windows 98 or higher operating system with a minimum 233 megaHertz (MHz) processor, 32 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), 50 MB of hard drive space and a 16-bit color monitor.
