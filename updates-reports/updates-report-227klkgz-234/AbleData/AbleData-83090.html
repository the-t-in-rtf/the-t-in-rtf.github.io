When this touch screen is connected to a computer, touching an on-screen object or word with a finger or stylus will generate input to the computer. This enables users to concentrate on the learning task because there are no intermediate steps or devices to interfere with their attention. Selection of commands, composition of graphics, and other functions can be performed. It can also be used as a switch by setting it flat on a table or wheelchair tray. It is compatible with most Macintosh and Windows software that works with a mouse. The device comes with an instruction manual, plastic stylus, mounting rails and buttons, and an installation guide. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Apple Macintosh or IBM and IBM-compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Macintosh with USB port, Mac OS 8.5.1 - 9.x operating system; G3, iMac or better; hard disk with 10 megabytes (MB) free; 32 MB random access memory (RAM); 640 x 480 pixels, 256 color display; CD-ROM drive.

For Macintosh with Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) port, System 6.0.5 or higher. For IBM-compatible with serial port, DOS/Windows 3.1/95/98 operating system (for later operating systems use USB version). OPTIONS: 15-inch screen version (works on 9-inch to 15-inch monitors) or 17-inch screen version (works on 16-inch to 17-inch monitors). WARRANTY: Full one year warranty.
