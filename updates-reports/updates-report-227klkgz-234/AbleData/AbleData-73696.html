This is an arcade-style game similar to video games such as Space Invaders and Missile Command. The player defends a starbase from the evil space commander, Lord Vector, and his bomber ships, fleet ships, lunar lifters, pods, moon rocks, and Gorbian ships. The player shoots through 16 levels of play and two bonus levels, scoring as many points as possible while protecting the starbase and picking up special items along the way like smart bombs, ground nukes, portals, and moon rock shields. Each level has its own set of stereo sound effects and accompanying techno music. On level 16, the player shoots it out with Lord Vector himself. Players can select from six missions, three difficulty levels, and two ship speeds. The game can be played using the keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. A utility program allows the player to remap joystick or gamepad buttons. This game is completely self-voicing, so it can be played without a separate screen reader program. The program comes with a documentation file. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98 or higher operating system; DirectX 8.0 or higher.
