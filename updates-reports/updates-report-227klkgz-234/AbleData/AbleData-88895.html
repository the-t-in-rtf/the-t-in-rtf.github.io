This program is available in the original disk version or the new CD-ROM format, and contains the same familiar characters from Thinkin&#x27; Things Collection 1. It is designed to help students learn to read and write rhymes and recognize symbol/sound relationships. There are also games to develop their memory, listening and observation skills. Songs in the program help students to build memory and auditory discrimination. Two additional activities take students into a world of art, motion, and dimension where they strengthen visual thinking and creativity as they experiment with perception, dimension and spatial relationships. Grow slides automatically increase as the student progresses. Teachers can view grow slides to observe progress, adjust the slides themselves, or let students adjust the slides. For students with a physical disability, touch screen access can be gained through TouchWindow (see separate entry). COMPATIBILITY: IBM/Tandy compatible or Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For use on Macintosh 256 color; System 6.0.7 or higher; 4 MB RAM (5MB required for System 7.5); hard disk; CD-ROM or 3-1/2 inch disk drive. Optional: Edmark TouchWindow; microphone. For IBM/Tandy - MS-DOS 3.1 or later; hard disk; mouse; SVGA with 1 MB RAM; 640K memory; 25 MHz 386 or better; 3-1/2 inch high density floppy drive (for installation); CD-ROM drive (for CD-ROM version); third party sound output device or card (with speaker). Supports Sound Blaster (see separate entry) and compatibles, Pro Audio and most popular sound output devices. OPTIONAL: Edmark TouchWindow; microphone.
