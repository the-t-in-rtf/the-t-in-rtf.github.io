This application (or app) for the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad enables caregivers to customize and present visual schedules and choice prompts to guide a person through daily events (such as a morning routine or therapy schedule) or through steps to complete a specific activity. Each schedule consists of images arranged in a specific order. Each image is intended to prompt the user to complete a specific activity. Audio clips can be associated with each image. Personal photos (created with the device&#x27;s camera or downloaded from the Internet) can be used for the schedules, and photos are available from the app&#x27;s stock image library. The caregiver or user can record his/her own voice and associate it with any image. First Then Visual Schedule allows the user to create as many schedules as needed and to change the order of schedules. The app also allows the user to add as many images as needed to create the steps necessary to complete a task within a saved schedule. Three different formats are available for use in each schedule: (1) For the &quot;Full screen&quot; format, a large image appears on the screen and the user accesses next image on the schedule by swiping the screen to the left; (2) when using the &quot;First-Then screen&quot; format, two images appear side by side with an arrow (left to right or top to bottom) between images to guide the sequence of the activity and each image has its own caption underneath; and (3) in the &quot;List Screen&quot; format, images are listed in a list format where four images are placed on a schedule. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
