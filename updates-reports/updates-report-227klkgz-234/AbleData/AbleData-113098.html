Developed by a consortium of over 80 hearing care companies worldwide, this program provides a unified system for performing client-related tasks. When a professional measures a client’s hearing loss, whether with audiograms, speech tests, or loudness scaling, results are passed automatically to the common database,
                                for use by any of several fitting systems from other suppliers. This allows the professional to try out alternative fitting systems from different suppliers when selecting and tuning a hearing instrument. The system can also be used to record journal notes regarding the client session. All information is automatically saved in the client’s record. This framework allows hearing instrument fitting, audiological measurement, and office management systems to share a common database. The program comes with modules for performing basic fitting and measurement functions. Additional fitting and measurement modules are available separately from licensed member companies. These modules allow the program to work with measurement equipment from more than 10 major suppliers and to fit hearing instruments from more than 30 different suppliers. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or network servers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows Vista, XP Professional (Service Pack 2), 2000 (Service Pack 4), 2008 Server, 2003 Server (Service Pack 1), or 2000 Server operating system (32-bit versions only); Pentium III 1 gigaHertz (GHz) processor; 512 megabytes (MB) RAM; 5 gigabytes (GB) of free hard drive space with 1 additional GB of free space for each installed module; screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels; CD drive; USB port for Bluetooth adapter; Internet Explorer version 5.5 or later; and Adobe Acrobat Reader.
