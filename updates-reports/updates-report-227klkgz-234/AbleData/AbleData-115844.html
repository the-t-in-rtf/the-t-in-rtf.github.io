                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Stickybear Math 2 Deluxe is a math tutorial program designed for children from second grade through fourth grade who have cognitive or learning disabilities. This program teaches children multiplication and division, beginning with the most elementary multiplication problems and continuing through more complex multiplication and division with regrouping. Animated instructions with audio explain each new concept and encourage children to investigate new skills. The program is divided into eight levels of multiplication and division covering 36 individual math skills including missing factors and dividends. Children will learn multiplication and division facts and advance to multiplication of multiple digits, problems that require regrouping, and long division with remainders. Teachers or parents can track students’ progress by level, number of problems attempted, number of problems correct, and percentage correct; and reports are available for each student or the entire classroom on screen or in printed form. Help screens are also available at each level and the program can be customized for the entire class or each student including starting level, on screen manipulatives, and auto-advance. A child can begin the program at any of the eight levels of proficiency. The school versions and above also come with freely reproducible lesson plans and manipulative masters. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: Windows or Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For hybrid direct drive: Windows 2000, XP, Vista or 7, CD ROM drive and from 150 to 260 MB of free space on the hard drive; Mac OS X v.10.4 or above, PowerPC or Intel processor, CD ROM drive and from 150 to 260 MB of free space on the hard drive. For stand alone CD: Windows 2000, XP or Vista, CD ROM drive, 32 MB of RAM; Mac OS 9, PowerPC, CD ROM drive, and 32 MB of RAM.
