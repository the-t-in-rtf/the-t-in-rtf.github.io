This bank account management software package provides printing and braille embossing of the check register, and enables writing checks in a variety of sizes and styles. The CD version (D-03560-00) comes with Enhanced Voicing speech. The electronic download version (D-03560-ED) has the same features as the CD version, except it is not supplied with Enhanced Voicing. However, the program can still be used with any other SAPI 5-compliant speech engine. The program includes a spoken, on-screen check register for recording all details of bank transactions and supports for multiple accounts. Cleared and running balances are spoken with a keystroke. The built-in speech can be turned off in order to use a screen reader instead. Font type and size are adjustable. The user can select and arrange register columns. Bank transaction information can be imported when downloaded in Quicken Interchange Format (QIF). The program provides a simple method for reconciling the user register with information from the bank. Recurring transactions can be scheduled, and transactions can be classified into categories and subcategories.  Registers are fully searchable, and summaries can be created by category or credit-debit. The check register can be printed in different font types and sizes, and embossed on either 11.5 inch wide or 8.5 inch wide braille paper. A User&#x27;s Guide is both self-spoken and available in HTML. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatibles computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista operating system; Internet Explorer 5.5 or later; 15 MB hard disk space and an additional 700 MB for high-quality speech; CD-ROM drive; sound card and speakers.
