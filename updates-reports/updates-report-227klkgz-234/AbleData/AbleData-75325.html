The Romeo Pro 50 looks like the Romeo 25 (see separate entry), but has aditional features and prints twice as fast. The Romeo Pro 50 prints single-sided braille at a rate of 50 characters per second, versus 25 for the Romeo 25. Standard features include ET Speaks, a fast and flexible speech system that comes up automatically and echoes commands as they are entered on the printer&#x27;s keypad. The unit uses continuous tractor feed paper, and has single sheet tractors that allow the user to hand-feed non-tractor paper one sheet at a time and it can handle paper weights ranging from standard computer paper through heavy index-type card stock. Dynamic Braille Scaling allows the user to change Braille sizes, even within a document, from Library of Congress Braille to California sign Braille, Jumbo Braille, standard Braille with increased line spacing, or the smaller Braille often preferred in Japan. Braille graphics can be printed at normal resolution for large shapes or at high resolution for finer detail. Sixteen menus allow the user to customize the Romeo Pro 50 for six- or eight-dot Braille, sideways printing, or multiple strikes per character. Up to 99 copies of one document can be printed automatically. The sound level is 75 decibels, but may vary with ambient conditions. The Romeo Pro 50 has one parallel port and two serial ports. It comes with an easily-transportable attache-style case with a handle. POWER: Uses either 105-130 volts alternating current (AC) or 210-260 volts AC. DIMENSIONS (HxLxW): 8.25 x 13.25 x 21.25 inches. The printer can be adjusted to handle paper 1.5 to 13.25 inches wide and 3 to 14 inches long. WEIGHT: 32 pounds.
