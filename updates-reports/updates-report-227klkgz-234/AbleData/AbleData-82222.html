The program is a style-based word processor (the user assigns a style to a block of text and the program handles all formatting commands). The program comes with predefined styles for items such as headings, items in a list, tables of contents and indices. The program can import documents from 95 different file formats (including Macintosh applications) and automatically applies styles, which can be changed based on formatting commands used by the original program. Braille output can also be viewed on the screen as a dot pattern and documentation included with the program gives an overview of the rules for producing proper braille documents. Other features include a large print option which enables print output in any size from 14 to 64 point; a choice of Grade 1, Grade 2, Computer Braille Code, or Linear Braille format; Grade 1 French, Spanish, Italian, or German; access via screen, voice, large print, refreshable Braille, or a combination thereof; and automatic correction of Braille data entry errors. Beginner Braille and MegaMath(see entry) are included. Although this is a DOS program, it launches from Windows and it can read and write Windows formats. The software includes a Windows installation program that automatically installs desktop icons and shortcuts. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM PC and compatible computers and most ink and braille printers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or 32-bit Vista (64-bit Vista with Virtual PC installed) and CD-ROM drive.
