This program allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to learn basic reading skills. The program features a Fun Park Haunted Mansion with screechy bats and owls and assorted peculiar characters. The child starts the app by hitting PLAY, touches an open window and a character will hold up a sign with a picture on it, then touches another window and tries to match pairs of pictures. The shutter closes when there is a match, and the round is won when all pairs are matched. The score is displayed and the next round appears. There are three mansion choices: eight windows (four pairs) which is easiest and suitable for the youngest, 10 windows (five pairs) which requires more patience and skill, and 12 windows (six pairs) which is the most challenging. The program comes with seven levels of play, each targeted at a different reading skill, helping the child to build sight vocabularies, reading, phonics and memory. 1. Picture-Picture: Match pictures to like pictures. 2. Picture-Word: Match a picture to its name in word form by associating the word in letters with the picture. 3. Simple Nouns: Match words from a list of simple nouns by recognizing the letter patterns and listening to the words. 4. Rhyming Words: Match words that rhyme. 5. Sight Words: Match the sight words. 6. Beginning Consonants: Match pairs of dissimilar words that start with the same letter. 7. Ending Consonants: Match pairs of dissimilar words that end with the same letter. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
