This application (or app) allows a parent to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to list the desired tasks or other behaviors that they desire a child to perform, record when that task or behavior is complete, and assign a reward to the child when the activity is complete. iRewardChart can support and track tasks for multiple children. Tasks can be selected from the built-in list of suggestions or entered by the parent or caregiver, and the value of each task can be established, expressed in stars. iRewardChart also allows the parent to create abstract goals like &quot;Patience&quot; or &quot;Sharing with others.&quot; For each child, a profile is created with the child&#x27;s name, picture and a list of rewards. Like tasks, rewards may be selected from a pre-loaded list, or custom rewards, such as &quot;$2 pocket money&quot; or &quot;One hour of TV time,&quot; may be created. Each reward is assigned a price, also in stars. Each child has a weekly calendar that shows their tasks and provides a place to record the completion of the tasks by assigning stars. A separate screen, the &quot;Balance Sheet,&quot; displays the total stars earned. As stars accumulate, the child can redeem them for rewards. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
