This app allows children to communicate through either picture-based or text-based messages. When in picture mode, children can access an extensive list of symbols representing core words and tap the symbols they want to enter into the message box. And when they are in text mode, they can type out their message word-by-word using the on-screen QWERTY keyboard. When they are done, they can tap on the message box to have their message spoken aloud. Avaz Lite also offers quick access to frequently used sentences, a vocabulary search bar, picture-assisted and text-assisted word prediction, as well as many other customizable features. Parents and caregivers can add multiple words into Avaz Lite, set vocabulary words with photographs or voice recordings, and track the child&#x27;s communication development through graphs and charts. Avaz Lite has more than 15,000 symbols in its Symbolstix vocabulary and four Ivona voices to choose from.<img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="End inserted content."/></ins>
