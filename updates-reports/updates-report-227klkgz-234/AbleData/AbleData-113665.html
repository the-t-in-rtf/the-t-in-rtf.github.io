This program can be used for making cause/effect activities from websites, DVDs, videos, or music. The program opens a window on the left of a screen on which the target is open. The user then positions the cursor over the desired target and presses S to start the counter. The program clicks on the Play link, which changes to a Stop link, and displays and counts down the number of seconds selected by the user. It then clicks on the Stop link, producing the cause/effect activity. The learner clicks to resume the activity. The program also works in Windows Media Player, QuickTime Player, iTunes, or any site that has continuous feedback. The program can be copied onto a flash drive and run from there, allowing it to be used on multiple computers. The software is available on CD (models SM-32 or SW-32) or in a downloadable version that can be tried up to 7 times as a demo, then becomes permanently operable with purchase of a registration code (models SM-32R or SW-32R). COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Any Windows operating system (models SW-32 or SW-32R) or any Mac (models SM-32 or SM-32R). An OS X upgrade from earlier versions is available.
