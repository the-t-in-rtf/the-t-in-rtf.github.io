                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>ED-IT PC is a braille text editor and braille translation program designed for use by individuals who are blind. This program is a production tool for braille transcribers. It is a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; (WYSIWYG) braille editing system that allows a braille transcriber to input and edit braille documents. Input can come from the keyboard in a six-key braille writer-style input mode, or from text files via an automatic print-to-braille translator. When the direct-input mode is used (six-key braille input), the system can be used to create any kind of braille document, including documents in music, math, and chemistry formats, as well as literary-format and textbook-format prose. The print-to-braille translator will accept prose (but not music or math) from ASCII text files, Rich Text files, WordPerfect files, or the Windows clipboard. This text editor and braille translation program can translate English to grade 2 braille and has a grade 2 spelling checker. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 3.1, 95, 98, or Me. The file editing part of this program will also run on Windows NT, 2000, and XP. This program requires a keyboard that responds to six-key input, that is, a keyboard manufactured per the original IBM personal computer (PC) specification. OPTIONS: Basic version with six-key input, an on-screen proofreading aid that back-translates braille prose into print, and automatic textbook-format page layout; Advanced version that adds to the above a grade 2 spelling checker and support for poetry formats; and Full Suite version that adds to the above the ability to automatically translate print prose into braille, from Rich Text and WordPerfect 6.1 files and from the Windows clipboard, and which also includes the Children&#x27;s Braille feature for handling double-spaced braille and for automatically simplifying a grade 2 document by replacing selected grade 2 forms with their grade 1 equivalent form for children who cannot yet read all of grade 2 braille.
