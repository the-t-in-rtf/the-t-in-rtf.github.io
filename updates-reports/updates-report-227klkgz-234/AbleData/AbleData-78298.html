Appropriate for students aged seven years through adult, this CD-ROM-based program provides self-paced, individualized reading instruction appropriate to the student&#x27;s ability level, from those with few or no reading skills through those seeking to improve speed and comprehension. Jim Larrabee, a special needs teacher and speech pathologist, is The Digital Teacher who presents his structured phonics-based program on three CD-ROMs with 47 interactive lessons plus practice activities. The technology combines audio and video with one-on-one instruction and feedback that responds to the individual student&#x27;s performance. The recommended time for the program&#x27;s use is five hours per week, with most students completing the program in 40 to 60 hours. Non-English speakers and students with low ability may need to complete the program twice for optimal results. This program teaches correct sound pronunciation and letter formation and alternative spelling of sounds and the role of spelling in word meaning. Other features include testing for mastery in five different ways on every lesson, automatic scheduling of review tests and reassignment of lessons as required, and tracking and reporting of student skill growth. The program also includes printable worksheets for off-line skill reinforcement and comprehension practice. For those using the school edition, the classroom teacher spends time with the student after the completion of every fourth lesson on off-line lessons and application of mastery; materials are included. The Single-Student Edition ($99 for the first student, plus $89 for each additional student) includes the three CD-ROM program, one 3.5-inch floppy disk enabling access of paid student(s) for 100 hours or one year, and printable worksheets. The School Edition ($5,000 for one workstation, $7,000 for two workstations, and $8,000 for three workstations; $1,000 for each additional work station) includes the three CD-ROM program with unlimited student access, a Teaching Guide, support materials, and one year of technical support. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or Power Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible requires Windows 95/98, a Pentium processor, 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM, 50 MB free hard drive space, CD-ROM drive, 16-bit color, Windows compatible sound card,  speakers, and a mouse. The Power Macintosh requires a 640e or faster processor (G3 or later recommended), MacOS 8.0 or later, 64 MB RAM, a minimum of 400 MB hard drive space (500 MB recommended), SoftWindows 98, CD-ROM drive, sound, speakers, and a mouse. A 3.5-inch floppy disk drive is required for the Single Student Edition. OPTIONS: Additional Teachers Guide (not included with the Single Student Edition), SoftWindows98 for the Power Macintosh, and an annual maintenance agreement beyond the first year for the School Edition.
