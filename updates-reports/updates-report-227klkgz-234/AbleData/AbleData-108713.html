This interface allows wireless connection of switches to computers, communication aids, toys, environmental controls, and other devices. The interface enables switches to be operated from anywhere within 12 feet, even through obstacles such as people and furniture. It works with all personal computer (PC) switch software that uses a standard switch interface, including Writing with Symbols, Clicker, and Sensory Software Programs (see entries). The system includes two transmitters for connecting to switches, and a receiver for connecting to the computer or other controlled device. Each of the transmitters has a 3.5-millimeter jack. The receiver is connected either to the RS232 serial port of the computer or the sockets of an existing switch adapter. Each set of transmitter and receivers has a unique code, printed on the receiver, so multiple interfaces can be used in the same room without interference. They are also resistant to interference from other radio emitters such as mobile phones and computers. There are three versions: A Universal version that connects to devices via two cables with 3.5-millimeter plugs, recommended for communication aids, environmental controls, and toys; and USB and Serial versions, recommended for computer applications. POWER: Transmitters for the USB and Serial versions use button cell batteries and the Universal version uses an internal rechargeable battery. The receiver requires no battery or external power supply. DIMENSIONS (HxLxW): Transmitters are 0.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches and the receivers are 5/8 x 5 3/16 x 2.5 inches. WARRANTY: The Radio-Link may be returned for a refund within 30 days.
