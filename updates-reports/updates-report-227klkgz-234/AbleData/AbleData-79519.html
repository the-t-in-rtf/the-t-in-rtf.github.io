REACH includes a variety of on-screen keyboards; word prediction with four vocabulary settings from 7,000 to 45,000 words, as well as customizable user dictionaries; two built-in augmentative communication systems, including one with a system of more than 120 &quot;speech keyboards&quot;; help with using a switch (e.g., a dwell switch and a ClickAssist feature that enables the user to define the click); help with pointing (e.g., a &quot;Wobble&quot; feature for smoothing the cursor); help with controlling other programs (e.g., keyboard keys can be assigned computer control or macro functions; a macro recorder is included); help for users with low-vision (e.g., customized high contrast keyboard themes and a zoom feature); many speech options (e.g., speaking keys or word prediction options when pointed at with the mouse or when pressed, speaking highlighted text, speaking letters/words/sentences automatically or &quot;on demand,&quot; etc.); a built-in assessment battery; and many tools for persons using switch scanning. More than 400 keyboards come with REACH, as well as the multimedia Keyboard Author program used to create them, enabling the user to modify any keyboard or create custom keyboards. Quicker &quot;Hot Authoring&quot; also is supported. This software includes built-in &quot;Windows Management&quot; tools (e.g., automatically resizing applications above the keyboard so the user does not have to drag or resize windows). A Help system and user&#x27;s manual are also included. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM or compatible computer. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP or better, Pentium IV processor or better, 256 megabytes (MB) RAM, 75 MB of hard drive space, and a sound card.
