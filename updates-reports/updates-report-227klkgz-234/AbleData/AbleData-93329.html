                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

The laryngograph can in turn be interfaced with a microcomputer to display and print these voice patterns. The user places two transducers (vibration detectors) against the larynx and speaks. The transducers are designed specifically to pick up and record movement of the chords and the opening and closing of the vocal folds, independent of extraneous acoustic noise and the qualities of the resonance tract. The system detects the complete pattern of vocal fold closure in each vibrating cycle, including closure duration and completeness, closure velocity, and coordination (sharpness) of the closure event. The trace of these events (the LX waveform) is generated, and can be transmitted to the computer or to an oscilloscope for display. In order for the waveforms to be displayed on the computer screen, an interface unit and appropriate software are required. The Laryngograph works with the Visi-Pitch system (also from Kay Elemetrics; see separate entries). The systems comes ready-to-use with one pair of transducers, three elastic neckbands, and internal large capacity NiCad battery and a separate battery charger. POWER: Rechargeable batteries. DIMENSIONS: 9.4 x 9.8 x 3.5 inches. WEIGHT: 3 pounds.
