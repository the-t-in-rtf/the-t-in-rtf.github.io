To contact a service center that uses this system, a customer only needs to call the center&#x27;s TTY number using a 45.5 baud device or a personal computer. The customer then receives a text-based welcome message and a list of service options from which to pick using a keyboard. When the customer chooses to interact with a live agent, the customer is transferred to a queue of agents using a TTY ranked by skill level. Contact center agents may themselves be deaf or hard of hearing. Statistics are kept on all TTY sessions by agent, including full dialog records. Frequently used text phrases are available to agents via dropdown boxes. Outbound calls are made with dial-out server software makes the server-based modem appear and function as a local modem, allowing any workstation to dial a TTY-TDD modem and communicate. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: These systems do not require a PBX or IVR, only a server and networked personal computers to accept software and cards.
