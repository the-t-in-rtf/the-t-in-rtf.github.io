                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

Keystrokes are generated by manipulating a small display via small pressures generated using a sip and puff mouthpiece. It is operated by scanning characters at a rate that is proportional to user applied vacuum. The system consists of a display module with all the characters of the keyboard on it and a sip and puff device. The user&#x27;s current position is indicated by one of the characters being lit up on the display, and is also represented in a larger format in the display area. Each of the four rows of characters can be scanned horizontally by sipping, and the scanning rate is controlled by the amount of force applied by the user&#x27;s sipping. The user slows down when in the vicinity of the correct character, and stops sipping when it is reached. Characters are selected by puffing gently; they then appear on the computer screen. The user sips sharply to change rows on the display panel, or puffs and holds to repeat the previous selection. The keying process typically can be learned in a few minutes. Proportional control allows relatively high speeds to be attained with practice. The entire process is electronic, does not require switch closure, and has no moving parts. The system attaches to the computer by means of the computer&#x27;s industry-standard RS-232 communications port. The price listed above includes the sip and puff device and &quot;Abilitywrite&quot; driver software. A telephone switch hook control module is an available option. The keyboard display can be mounted on top of a video monitor. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM PS/2 Models 25/30, IBM PS/2 Models 50/60, IBM PC or compatible computers. POWER: 120 volt AC. DIMENSIONS: Control size is 4 x 8 x 8 inches. WEIGHT: 4 pounds.
