The program is designed to develop important skills and thought processes for scientific learning including sorting, sequencing, and problem solving. Students will expand their science vocabulary as they learn about plants, animals, seasons and weather. They also observe, classify, construct, compare, and experiment. All directions are graphical or spoken in clear, friendly voices for pre-readers. This progam includes built in scanning for single switch users and is TouchWindow accessible (see separate entry). It is available on diskette or CD-ROM. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh SE or later, or IBM/Tandy or compatibles.
