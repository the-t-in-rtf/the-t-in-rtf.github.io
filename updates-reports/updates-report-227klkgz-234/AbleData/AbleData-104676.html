The simulation was created using game-based technology to provide an interactive environment in which parents and caregivers learn to effectively implement behavioral strategies and techniques. The simulation displays realistic 3D images of a virtual child engaging in challenging behaviors. The user is required to choose an intervention based on principles such as positive reinforcement and extinction. The child’s behavior will become more or less agitated depending on the user’s timing and choice. The goal is to provide parents and caregivers with an opportunity to learn and practice reinforcing skills they want to see increase and to use extinction to reduce rates of behaviors they would like to see decrease. To progress, the user will have to master different skills at each level. Additional behavioral concepts include: shaping, chaining, correction, functional analysis, and the teaching strategies of discrete trial, prompt fading, and errorless teaching.
