The program allows children to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to practice sounds in words and sentences with a therapist, parent, or independently. PhonoPix features flashcard and matching activities with minimal pairs to contrast children’s incorrect responses with the target responses. Example minimal pairs include “tea” and “key,” “ton” and “sun,” and “bee” and “beach.” The program includes 10 decks with 40 minimal pairs in each (400 total pairs) for these phonological processes: prevocalic voicing, word final voicing, final consonant deletion, fronting (palatal and velar), marked blend reduction, unmarked blend reduction, gliding(“l” and “r” sounds), stopping, backing (palatal and velar), and initial consonant deletion. Users can combine card decks and specify ordering; choose sound groups to practice; copy scores to clipboard, email and Google Spreadsheet; and configure options for app sounds (audio recordings) and visuals (hide matched cards, unmatched card delay). Other features include color coded cards, auto-play of audio recordings, tap-to-play audio, audio feedback for scoring, and sound group title added to the top of flashcards and matching cards to clarify scoring. In the flashcard activity, children can view minimal pairs in double-sided flashcards by flicking through an album and tapping an around button. Children will have fun matching minimal pairs in three different levels: easy with 3 pairs, medium with 6 pairs, and hard with 10 pairs in the matching activity. Children practice by listening to the recorded audio, recording their voice to self-monitor, and collecting scores during these activities.  Scores are saved in the app for up to four children at a time. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
