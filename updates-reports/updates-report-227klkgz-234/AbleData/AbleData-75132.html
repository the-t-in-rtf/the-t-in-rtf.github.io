                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>The Audio Graphing Calculator (AGC) is an audible graphing calculator program designed for use by individuals who are blind or have low vision or visual dyslexia. This on-screen graphing calculator is capable of displaying graphs or other sets of y-versus-x data both visually and audibly as a tone graph. The audio tone plot gives users access to plots comparable to that on standard graphing calculators. The AGC also has advanced matrix functions as well as the abilities to locate polar coordinates , display multiple graphs, and find intersections. The program is entirely accessible in audio through a variety of non-speech sound cues and a self-voicing speech engine. It also features speaking menus, scalable visual display, keyboard navigation, and tactile output options. The combination of visual and audible cues is helpful to individuals with visual learning disabilities or math anxiety. In addition to its ability to graph and display functions, this calculator program has the standard features of a hand-held scientific graphing calculator. Along with an on-screen keypad scientific calculator, it has an expression evaluator that permits the user to define, save, and recall constants such as those used frequently in the physical sciences and in engineering. In addition to English, the AGC supports German, Norwegian, Polish, Swedish and Japanese. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7 (32- and 64-bit), Vista (32- and 64-bit)or XP (32-bit); 200 megahertz (MHz) Pentium (or equivalent) processor with 256 megabytes (MB) of RAM; 35 megabytes of hard drive space; a sound card; and a display with a minimum resolution of 800 x 600. OPTIONS: This product may be purchased on CD or downloaded from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site.
