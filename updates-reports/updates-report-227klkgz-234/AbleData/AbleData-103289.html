This program is a progressive language development system with ready-to-use pages designed by speech language pathologists who specialize in using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices in clinical settings. Covering all levels of language development from preschool through adult, Language-Links includes pragmatic based pages (Language-Links Core) as well as grammatically and semantically based (Language-Links Prime) pages. Throughout each of the progressive page set structures, there is a strong emphasis placed on content continuum from one level to the next. This approach is beneficial to AAC users because they only have to learn new content as they progress to the next level, as they are already proficient at the repetitive content from the previous level. All levels of Language-Links follow the Fitzgerald Key of color coding for AAC materials. Color coding helps individuals find words by the category they are in and helps make the AAC display easier to navigate by differentiating word categories. Language-Links Core is a progressive set of pragmatically focused communication page sets ranging from preschool communication needs through adult (6 location cell densities to 48 location cell density). Language-Links Core is based on an AAC user’s pragmatic skills and ability to communicate based on the context of the situation or desired wants and needs. This provides many opportunities for use of quick talk messages to be used for fluent communication. Language-Links Core provides many areas of communicative intent such as positive and negative comments, wants and needs, questions, and much more. Along with the pragmatic based communication content, the user also has access to additional content as the level of page sets progresses. This allows the user to not only use the pragmatically based quick content but unique sentence production as well. This provides a whole language approach to communication while promoting communicative independence in any situation. Language-Links Prime is a progressive set of grammatically focused communication page sets ranging from beginning language development through advanced language development (6 location cell density to 30+ location cell density). Language-Links Prime is based on sentence structure and development from subject-verb, noun-verb, and subject-verb-noun combinations to complete sentence production including adverbs, adjectives, verb conjugation, and much more. The progressive nature of the Language-Links Prime communication system makes it appropriate for people of all ages from preschool through adults.
