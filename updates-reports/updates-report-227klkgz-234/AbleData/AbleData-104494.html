This application (or app) allows a person to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad as a task organizer and scheduler. Schedules can be created with pictures or videos. The user can organize video modeling content and turn off schedule functions such as &quot;Done.&quot; Schedules and modeling created by the user can be shared with other users. The user can also customize the app with the following features: various orientation locks that prevent the user from engaging in stimulatory behaviors with the video; three video and picture sizes; and a pass code function that prevents the user from skipping around to preferred aspects or events of his or her schedule. Schedules are initially set to portrait mode and can be changed to landscape mode in &quot;Settings.&quot; The video component only works with devices with a built-in camera. Video Scheduler can be used to create picture schedules with devices without a built-in camera. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later.
