JAWS for Windows installs its own speech synthesizer software, Eloquence for JAWS, which works with the Windows sound card and supports nine languages (U.S. and British English, Latin American and Castilian Spanish, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Finnish). Interactive talking installation makes it easy to set up without sighted assistance. All standard Windows applications, including Microsoft Office XP, are supported without the need for special configuration. Microsoft Internet Explorer is supported, including special features such as links lists, frames lists, forms mode, HTML tables, and graphic labels. A unique scripting language allows customization of nonstandard Windows applications and proprietary software, while other tools allow customization without the need to write scripts. Output is provided to most popular refreshable Braille displays in computer or Grade 2 Braille. New features in JAWS for Windows version 4.01 include support for Windows XP help balloons, support in all Windows operating systems for display settings with more than 256 colors, and automatic disabling of non-optimal visual effects. JAWS for Windows 4.01 comes with a Windows Basic Training Tutorial with over seven hours of audiocassette instruction. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: A computer that will run Windows 95/98/Me/XP Home (Standard Edition) or Windows 95/98/Me/XP Home/NT/2000/XP Pro (Professional Edition); a Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT/2000 Pro compatible sound card to run the Eloquence for JAWS synthesizer, or another JAWS-compatible synthesizer; 32 MB of available random access memory (RAM) for the Standard Edition and 64 MB for the Professional Edition using Windows 2000; 50 MB of available hard disk space; and a VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA 256-color recommended). OPTIONS: Standard Edition or Professional Edition, Software Maintenance Agreement, and Multi-User Licensing.
