Software is a money management training system in a game format designed for use with individuals with learning and other cognitive disabilities. This game uses realistic currency to teach basic money handling skills and requires players to conduct money transactions at the grocery store, restaurant, mall, and shopping mart. It focuses on ways to earn money, pay bills, and deal with unexpected expenses. Draw cards inform players of how much money they will receive or what they will pay for an item. This software provides voice prompts and graphics to cue one to four players. The software provides options such as Instructions, Timer which can be set to determine the length of the game, Check Score, and Quit Game. The actual game screen offers choices as Roll Die (an animated die rolls), Bank (allows players to withdraw from savings), Wallet (holds the players&#x27; money and enables them to pay or get funds), and Score (dispays current score). To play, a player clicks on the roll button and the die rolls and the player&#x27;s pawn moves the appropriate number of spaces to land on a category. The player then clicks to draw a card from that category and follows the instructions illustrated either to spend money (i.e., paying for a game of bowling) or to receive money (i.e., receiving $10 as a gift). The player clicks on the &quot;Wallet&quot; button and the button blinks to cue the player. The amount to pay or get is shown on the screen and the player clicks on realistic-looking coins and bills until the correct amount is reached. Players are given five tries per turn to reach the correct amount. COMPATIBILITY: Available for use on IBM and compatible computers or for use on Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM and compatible computers: 386 DX or higher, 8 megabytes (MB) RAM, a Soundblaster or compatible sound card, 16 MB free hard drive space, and a 640 x 480 256-color Super VGA (SVGA) monitor. For Macintosh computers: MacIIci or higher, System 7 or higher, 8 MB RAM,  16 MB free hard drive space, and a 640 x 480 256-color monitor.
