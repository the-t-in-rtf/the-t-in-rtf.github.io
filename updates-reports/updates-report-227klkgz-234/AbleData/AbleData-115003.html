The program allows an individual to use an Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch as a communicator and cognitive aid. iCommunicate allows an image (including a picture or a symbol) to be related to a specific word or phrase and to an audio clip. The user selects a picture and the associated audio clip will play. If no audio recording is available, the program has a text-to speech feature. The system also supports creation of two types of screens - (1) the 10 x 4 communication board in which the user touches a picture to play the associated sound, and (2) a task completion mode in which the user views a sequence of pictures one picture at a time and swipes to move forward and back in the sequence.  In the task completion mode, each picture represents a task to be completed by the user. The user can touch a picture with his/her finger for over a second to add or remove a checkmark that indicates that the task is completed. 100 pictures are included with the app, five of which come with associated audio. Pictures can be added as needed, and the app is compatible with over 10,000 SymbolStix images. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
