The Match Cooking Prep System is designed to provide practical tools that assist someone with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to learn how to cook. The Match Cooking Prep System is based on Syracuse University graduate Amanda Savitzky&#x27;s personal experience as a sibling of an individual with ASD. The system consists of measuring cups, prep bowls, and an iPad app. The project focuses on food preparation and creates a structure in the place of the constant redirection between cupboards and the refridgerator in gathering ingredients for individuals with ASD. The Match bowls are numbered and filled according to a recipe prompting the user to follow a recipe&#x27;s sequenced instructions. The measuring utensils devised to fill the bowls are  distinguished by color and shape and they have larger sized handles that provide a more secure palmar grip. Consulting with Natalie Russo, Professor of Psychology at Syracuse University, Savitzky drew upon the principles of the Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) for the linear left to right layout of the Match Prep Cooking System. The TEACCH workstations employ a standardized physical layout that creates structure and routine, two powerful ways to encourage learning for people with autism. Ultimately, the Match system aims to support the learner with ASD and their teacher to achieve as much independence as possible. A central component of the Match system will be an iPad app that takes complex cooking preparation tasks and breaks them down into small steps. The app will enable users to divide recipes into the following tasks: gather, measure, combine, and prep. This task breakdown will be turned into a visual slide show that can be customized with familiar images from individual kitchens. The design of the app will take recipe measurements such as &quot;1 cup&quot; and display them as the corresponding Match system measuring cup symbol. AUTHOR: Donna Taylor.
