                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

A team of searchers from Scotland has developed a Computer Interactive Reminiscence and Conversation Aid (CIRCA).  CIRCA is compromised of a simple touch-screen with easy-to-follow instructions and requires no IT competence. When switched on, CIRCA displays a choice of three random categories (entertainment, local life, etc.). After selecting a category, the user is then given a choice of “music”, “photo”, or “video”. The user’s selection results in CIRCA calling up images, video or sound clips from a database.  The multimedia from the database acts a memory trigger and a conversation prompt. CIRCA is equipped with a “stop and talk” button which allows the system to be frozen at any point. CIRCA creates a feeling of a “shared” experience between the consumer and his or her caregiver. Moreover, the easy-to-use touch screen and prompts from the CIRCA system allow the consumer to be more in control of his or her experience and less dependent on the caregiver.
