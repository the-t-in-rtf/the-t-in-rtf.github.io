This Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) text-based mobile app is designed to help children and adults with communication or speech disabilities communicate via the app’s text-to-speech function. Predictable 4+ has an on-screen keyboard and offers word prediction and completion features. Based on letters the user has already typed in the message box, several different word prediction options will appear in a space just above the on-screen keyboard. The user can tap on the word he or she wants from among these options, complete typing out his or her message, and then tap the “Speak” button to have the app read the message aloud.
                                 
                                Predictable 4+ is also switch accessible, so users with significant physical disabilities can use the app using one or two external switches. It also offers a “Touch Anywhere” method (this turns the entire touch screen into a switch so that the user can select the scanned portion by tapping anywhere on the screen). Predictable 4+ provides several different voice options including four ModelTalker voices, ModelTalker Voice banking (allows the user to use his or her own synthesized voice to communicate), and any of the in-built iOS voices. The app’s on-screen keyboard also comes in four different layouts including the QWERTY layout, the ABC layout, the high frequency layout and the 10-key layout. It also stores quick phrases and prepared messages in a category folder system.
