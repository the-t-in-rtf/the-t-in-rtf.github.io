It uses a rich variety of graphics to engage and stimulate learners of any age. It presents wholes, halves, thirds, quarters, sixths, and eighths in illustrations showing familiar and appealing food items. The program provides students with practice in naming and recognizing fractions as parts of a unit whole, as parts of collections, and as measurements. The program also provides students with the opportunity to identify equivalent fractions. The program has three activities: a Name activity displays items that name themselves when selected; a Match activity presents items to be matched to an array of two or more items; and a Concentration Game rewards correct matches with vivid photographs depicting real-life occasions for using fractions. Teachers can choose which fractions and which objects are presented in these activities. The program also includes quizzes teachers can use for progress assessment. Results can be saved and printed as a permanent record. The program is IntelliKeys and touch screen compatible. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Macintosh version requires a PowerMac and operating system OS7.6 or later. The Windows version requires a Pentium processor or better and Windows 95 or later with a sound card. Both versions require 16-bit high-color graphics. OPTIONS: Intellikeys overlays.
