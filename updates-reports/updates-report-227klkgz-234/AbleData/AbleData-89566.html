The standard system includes one cable and six plastic user overlays, (arrows, numbers, alphabet, basic writing, QWERTY, and one setup overlay used to adjust IntelliKeys for specials needs such as keyboard response and repeat rate). The overlays enable users to access standard learning software and are easy to see, touch and understand. They can be used at home or work and rotated among different computers with the custom information still intact. ItelliKeys features two switch jacks with 11 pre-defined settings. The system is also available with three cables ($435) or without cables ($395.00). COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh computers (except Mac 512K and Mac Plus), IBM and compatible computers, and Apple IIgs and Apple IIe. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: An IntelliKeys IIe Card ($129.95) is required for use with Apple IIe computers. IntelliKeys is compatible with most other systems with a standard keyboard port. OPTIONS: Keyguards for each of the standard overlays (sold individually or as a set), Instant Access Overlays for Edmark software programs such as Bailey&#x27;s Book House, Millie&#x27;s MAth House, Sammy&#x27;s Science House and Thinkin&#x27; Things Collection 1 (see separate entries), Intellikeys Custom Overlays for Marblesoft programs such as the Early Learning series, and additional cables. DIMENSIONS: Key cells measure 0.324 inches tall by 0.5 inches wide. Overlays measure 8.5 inches tall by 13 inches wide. WEIGHT: Keyboard weighs two pounds. WARRANTY: Intellikeys is warranted for one year against defects in materials and workmanship.
