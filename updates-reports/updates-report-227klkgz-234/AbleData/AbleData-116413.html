There are 93 Level 1 Stories and 58 Level 2 Stories. Articulation Station Pro features in-depth scoring and data tracking for each user and allows up to 6 users for a single sessions. It also has the ability to shuffle multiple sounds, and it has a voice recording and playback feature for monitoring responses. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad.
