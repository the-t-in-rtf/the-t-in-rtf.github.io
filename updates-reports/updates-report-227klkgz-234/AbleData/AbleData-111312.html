This alpha-numeric keyboard is a 53-key, USB-interface keyboard alternative to a standard Qwerty keyboard. The keyboard offers all the functions of a full-sized 104-key keyboard and is designed to reduce the learning curve for touch typing as well as make the task comfortable. The logical design of the keyboard reduces the number of keys so they are all within easy reach, then lays them out where the fingers naturally move for comfort, speed and accuracy. The letters are arranged alphabetically in such a way that the most common sequences are the easiest to type, even for one-handed typing. The alphabet is broken into small, familiar groups of four or five letters. The shift keys are centralized for operation by the index fingers or thumbs instead or relying on the little fingers, and tactile landmarks lead the hands to an obvious home position. The keys are color-coded to aid in learning the layout. The keyboard requires no drivers and has three-position slope adjustment (flat, +10 degrees, and -10 degrees). COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible notebook or desktop computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: USB port and Windows 98SE, ME, 2000, XP, or Vista. For additional character sets, Microsoft Office is required. DIMENSIONS: 12.5 x 5 x 7/8 inches thick.  WEIGHT: 13 ounces. COLOR: White casing with keys colored by function. Key labels are black.
