This daily living skills workbook includes units on the stove, oven, freezer, microwave, refrigerator, and a review section. Each chapter moves in sequence from general to specific facts. New information is gradually increased with continuous repetition. The review chapter compares and contrasts the appliances. Both function and safety tips are incorporated into the lessons. The worksheets are self- explanatory, and Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) are used throughout so that students do not require reading skills to respond to questions. After each appliance is introduced, there are cut and past, multiple choice, and fill in the blank activities.
