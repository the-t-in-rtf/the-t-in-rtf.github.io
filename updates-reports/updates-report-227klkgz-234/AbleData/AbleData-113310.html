It is intended to be used as an add-on for the Tobii Communicator software package and is designed for users without literacy skills to build their own sentences word by word. Sono Lexis is based on visual recognition of symbols that represent words, phrases and categories. The system combines motor memory learning by navigation architecture with the Fitzgerald Key, a one-symbol-per-concept layout. The system contains a core vocabulary of flexible and generic words that make up a large portion of spoken language. The different groups of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, short words, articles, question words) are arranged systematically. Each group of words appears in a different color. Sono Lexis’s navigation functions offer a variety of feedback features, maximum structure consistency, and a step-by-step complexity gauge. The system features individualized page sets, grammar functions like changing verb tenses, three different grid sizes, visualization functions and an on-screen keyboard. Other features include support for communicating by cell phone, text message (SMS), instant messaging, and email. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Tobii Communicator (see separate entry) Version 4.3 or higher. The Premium version of Communicator is required to access Sono Key’s e-mail-related features.
