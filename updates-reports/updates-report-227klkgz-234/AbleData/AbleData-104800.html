Each game focuses on a specific set of abilities, and enables the user to select difficulty levels and other settings. Therapists, teachers and parents can adjust the games to the child’s specific needs.
                                All five games share the same identifying character – Timocco the friendly monkey. During play, children help Timocco achieve his tasks as they navigate a vivid new world.
                                In order to play, the user slips each hand into a brightly colored sphere glove whose location is accurately tracked by the webcam. In some of the games the users hands actually control Timocco’s hands, creating a virtual world immersion experience, and in other games the user operates the tools Timocco uses for his activities, such as brushes to paint with or pins with which to pop balloons.
                                Each game focuses on a different motor or cognitive skill, such as posture, bilateral coordination, cross-midline maturation, eye-hand coordination or visual discrimination. In addition, each activity can be adapted to the user&#x27;s developmental stage, their specific needs and their pace of progress.
                                Features like task duration, speed, number of stimuli, appearance of distractions and other parameters are easily adaptable, and the program is designed to keep a full record of the user’s performance, including the number of errors, of hits and the path of their hand’s motion.
