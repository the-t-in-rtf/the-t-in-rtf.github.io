The program has three separate activities designed to help students with positional language, understanding of processes, and matching objects to suitable locations. In these activities the users find the spider hiding behind objects in the kitchen while engaging in familiar kitchen activities. Users must name familiar kitchen objects and say where they belong. They must distinguish positions in/on/under, above/below/beside, and in front of/behind objects. They must identify the normal sequence of kitchen activities such as making cereal, toast, a sandwich, or a cup of tea, and can watch the consequences of missing the sequence (for example, of pouring too much milk into the cereal bowl). The program is configurable for those who use a mouse, a touchscreen, one or two switches, or IntelliKeys (see separate entry). The program has full text and speech support. The program has many saveable options, such as allowing more thinking time, and comes with auto-loading IntelliKeys overlays. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: CD-ROM drive.
