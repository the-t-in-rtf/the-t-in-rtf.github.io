The program also provides a speech feedback option to assist people with visual and cognitive disabilities to hear word choices and selection. When the user types in the first letter of a word, a list of several words beginning with that letter appears at the bottom of the screen. If the desired word is in the list, the user types in the number corresponding to the correct word or positions the cursor at the correct word and presses the space bar. Access to punctuation and grammatically correct endings (-ing, -ed, -ly, etc.) is also provided. The program draws from a 1500-word vocabulary to make predictions, and collects new words during use and offers these words as future word choices. The program can be tailored to the individual by selecting the number of word choices presented, choosing grammar on/off, and using the optional speech capabilities. Predict It has standard word processor functions such as cut, copy, paste, move, delete, and save. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple IIe (128K), Apple IIc/c+, and Apple IIGS computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 128K memory; Predict It 5.25 requires a 5.25-inch disk drive, Predict It 3.5 requires a 3.5-inch disk drive; an ECHO speech synthesizer is required for speech output.
