                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Play Attention is a biofeedback-based cognitive and behavioral training program designed for use by children with cognitive or learning disabilities affecting attention, concentration, or focus. The system includes a sensor-lined helmet that is worn by the child. The sensors monitor the child&#x27;s attentive state and cognitive process, which is fed into a small interface system that attaches to a computer (not included). Users complete a series of video game-like exercises that are controlled by the mind alone, and can see and hear real-time feedback of how they are progressing in focusing, finishing tasks, increasing memory, and filtering out distractions. Feedback is continuous and immediate. Behavior can be modified to reduce or eliminate calling out, fidgeting, and impulsivity, while improving time-on-task, focus, and comprehension. The package includes interactive software, a human/computer interface helmet, and access to a professional support advisor to help individualize the program. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: IBM-compatible computers require Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating system; 300 megaHertz (MHz) Intel or AMD processor (500 MHz recommended); 128 megabytes (MB) RAM (random access memory); 250 MB free hard drive space; sound card and speakers; CD-ROM drive; and a free serial (COM) port. Macintosh computers require OS 10.3 operating system; G3, G4, or iMac; 128 MB RAM; 250 MB free hard drive space; CD-ROM drive; and free USB port.
