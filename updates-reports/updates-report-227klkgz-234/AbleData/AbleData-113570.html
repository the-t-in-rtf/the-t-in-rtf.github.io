On this keyboard, the numeric keypad is on the left, so the mouse (not included) is closer to the alphabetic keys and, therefore, easier to reach when it is placed to the right of the keyboard. This allows the user&#x27;s right arm to be in a relaxed neutral position when using the mouse, and reduces the need to remove the right hand from the mouse in order to operate Enter, Del, Page Up, Page Down, arrows, and other keys in the numeric keypad. Other modifications in this keyboard include duplicate Page Up, Page Down, Home, End, Del, and arrow keys on the right; full size arrows, Del, Fs, Ctrl, and Alt keys; an extra Del key at the left end of the spacebar to allow left hand operation while the right hand is on the mouse; tactile bumps on often used keys such as Del, End, Page Down, Ctrl, and down arrow to aid operation by touch; hot keys for one touch access to the Internet, e-mail, media player, volume control, standby, power off, and other functions; notebook computer-type key mechanisms; flat key caps. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible, Macintosh, and Linux- and Unix-based computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For all computers a USB port is required. For personal computers (PCs) require Windows XP for full functionality; some hotkeys on the top row may not work in other Windows versions. For Macintosh, Unix, and Linux, all keys are functional except for some hotkeys on the top row. For Macintosh, the Windows key is the Mac key, the eject key is pressing and holding F12, and Num Lock is locked on. DIMENSIONS (HxDxW): 0.5 x 6.25 x 15.4 inches. COLOR: Black keys with white characters and silver frame.
