This system features wireless remotes with large LCD screens, big buttons and a range of up to 100 feet; a receiver that connects to a computer using a USB connection and can either be mounted on a wall or placed on a desk; and assessment software that integrates with SMART Notebook collaborative learning software. Students use the remotes to answer questions, receive instant feedback and stay involved in lessons. Teachers create true-or-false, yes-or-no, or multiple choice questions using SMART Notebook software, and each answer automatically corresponds to one of the five buttons on the remotes. The buttons are green, red, blue, yellow and purple, and each button is labeled with a different white shape on each button as a simple label. When students respond to questions, the software summarizes the results in a pie chart or bar graph for everyone in the room to see. The system also allows students to respond anonymously. Teachers can use the built-in gradebook to access reports and track student performance; and use questions from third-party question banks or import questions from other software programs. This system is available with 12, 18, 24 and 32 remotes. A carrying case for all remotes is included. COMPATIBILITY: IBM PC and Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows XP, Vista or 7, Pentium 4 or better processor, 512 megabytes (MB) RAM, and 1.23 gigabytes (GB) hard disk space; Mac OS X 10.5.8 or better, 1.5 gigaHertz (GHz) Intel processor or better, 1 GB RAM and 1.23 MB hard disk space. POWER: Each remote uses two AA batteries (included). DIMENSIONS (WxHxD): Receiver: 4.75 x 0.88 x 2.25 inches; remote: 2.25 x 5.63 x 1.13 inches. WEIGHT: 5.75 ounces (receiver); 7.25 ounces (remote). WARRANTY: Two-year limited equipment warranty.
