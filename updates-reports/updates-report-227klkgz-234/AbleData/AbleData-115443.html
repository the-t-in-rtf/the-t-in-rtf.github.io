Researchers at Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) have developed a an iPhone application, iTrem, allowing users to monitor Parkinson’s disease and other neurological conditions by collecting data from arm and hand tremors.  The iTrem makes use of the built-in accelerometer found in the iPhone to collect data from a patient who is at home or at the office. The data is then sent to medical personnel to be analyzed. Using the application, patients can monitor their conditions without having to pay costly visits to medical facilities. Future developments include additional Parkinson’s related tests, and possibly the ability to detect and analyze dyskinesia, a movement disorder.  iTrem is currently undergoing clinical study at Emory University and will need to receive approval from the FDA before it is available from the Apple App Store, which is expected to happen later this year.
