                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Learn to Talk is a voice output flash card program, a language, reading and vocabulary tutorial program and a speech training program designed for use by parents working with children who have cognitive, communication, hearing, learning, physical, or speech disabilities or autism. This application (or app) was developed by a speech therapist to allow a parent to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to facilitate language development in children with specific language impairments such as receptive or expressive language delay or autism spectrum disorder. The app includes over 160 flash cards and uses both sight and sounds to teach children basic vocabulary and early language skills. For each lesson, a child swipes with his or her fingers to the left for the next card to appear on the screen or swipes to the right to go back one. The child can listen to, repeat and learn the words and phrases as he or she flips through the cards. Sounds can be turned off, and flash cards can be switched to &quot;shuffle&quot; mode so the child can practice language production independently. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
