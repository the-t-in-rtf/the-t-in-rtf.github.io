                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>The IntelliTools Classroom Suite is an academic reading, writing and math tutorial program and an assessment and evaluation system for children with cognitive or learning disabilities from pre-kindergarten (Pre-K) through the fifth grade. This software was developed based upon the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that combines two educational paradigms—systematic, explicit instruction and flexible creativity tools. It is designed to allow teachers to have control over specific learning objectives, allowing differentiated instruction for individuals or groups to help students in grades PreK-5 achieve mastery in reading, writing, and mathematics. The Classroom Suite is designed to be used for supplemental instruction, as a response to intervention and for curriculum support for students with cognitive or physical disabilities. It has built in alternative access through IntelliKeys (see separate entry) and switch scanning. As a supplement to core curriculum, Classroom Suite provides basic concept building and reinforcement with the ability to create custom units and activities. As an intensive intervention tool, Classroom Suite provides more than 4,000 activities created by teachers and therapists that support foundation skills, templates that address early learning skills, and curriculum content from other curriculum developers delivered through Classroom Suite. This product’s primary focus is to support and reinforce beginning literacy, writing and number sense. Out-of-the-box lessons incorporate a system of &quot;model, practice, apply&quot; to ensure that students understand each educational objective set by the teacher. Students receive practice with strategic feedback and are immediately assessed to determine whether to move on to another activity or to receive additional practice. OPTIONS: Classroom Suite Math Tutor; Classroom Suite Reading Tutor; Classroom Suite Primary Skills Builder; Classroom Suite Alternative Access Kit; and ReadyMade Story Kits. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM compatible computers, Windows XP, Vista, or 7 operating system; Intel Core 2 Duo or better processor with 1 gigabyte (GB) or greater RAM (at least 2GB for Vista or 7); 1.5 GB or more hard disk space; 16-bit hi-color 1024 x 768 pixels or higher display resolution; sound recording and playback ability; QuickTime 7.6; DVD drive. For Macintosh computers, Mac OS X 10.4 to 10.8; PowerPC G3 or Intel Core 2 Duo or better processor with 2 GB or greater RAM; 512 megabytes (MB) or greater RAM; 1.5 GB or more hard disk space; 16-bit hi-color 1024 x 768 pixels or higher display resolution; sound recording and playback ability; Internet connect (1 MB per second or faster); DVD drive.
