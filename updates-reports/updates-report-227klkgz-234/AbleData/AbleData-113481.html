It enables students to practice their braille writing skills by entering the answers to the SAL2 writing exercises on an electronic braille keyboard. This unit can be used to complete writing exercises set by the SAL2 virtual tutor (see separate entry). The student receives immediate feedback from SAL2 as to the accuracy of their writing and they experience the feel of using an electronic braille keyboard. This unit plugs into the USB port of a computer. No additional cables, drivers or software are needed. The keyboard is laid out like a standard braille notetaker, with six-dot keys, a space bar and two navigation keys. It can also be used for six-key entry of braille in any braille transcription software program, such as Duxbury, MegaDots, or Braille 2000. The keyboard comes with Power Chord Editor, a software application that enables words and characters to be spoken aloud as they are entered on the keyboard in either contracted or uncontracted literary braille. The computer monitor shows the simulated braille on screen and the student can toggle to show the print view. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Personal computers (PC) require Windows 98 or higher operating system. Macintosh requires OS X or higher operating system.
