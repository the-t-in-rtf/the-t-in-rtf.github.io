                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Multimedia Plocka is an educational program with cause and effect, matching and sorting, sequencing, numbers, language, and games activities, designed for use by children with cognitive, learning, communication, upper extremity, and fine motor disabilities. In this multimedia program, learning is enhanced with graphics, sound, and video. The program uses the principle of objects and targets. On-screen shapes, pictures, or text are scanned and selected with switches or the keyboard. Once selected, these choices are automatically moved to chosen target areas. Designers, teachers, and therapists can adjust the nature and complexity of the tasks. Age-appropriate shapes can be selected from a built-in picture library of animals, trees, clothes, transport, and food, or from clip art libraries, scanned images, or a photo-CD. Output to a speech synthesizer and/or real recorded sound can be used to aid and motivate students, prompting responses and indicating switch actions in order to make tasks easier and more interesting. Video sequences or animations can be added to give stimulating rewards. The program comes with a set of ready-made introductory screens and activities including cause and effect, numbers, matching, sequencing, games, language and sorting. A tutorial guide on how to modify these screens is also included. OPTIONS: Standard version or switch users version. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95 operating system; 486 or better processor; sound card; 4 megabytes (Mb) random access memory (RAM) and 640 kilobytes (Kb) hard disk space. The switch users version may also require a separate switch interface box.
