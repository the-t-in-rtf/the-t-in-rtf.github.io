The program is designed to help develop visual perception and language skills as well as early switch techniques. The program can be accessed through a single switch or through the keyboard, a touch screen, or a mouse. This cause and effect switch program has simple graphics, animation, and sound rewards. It is suitable for all ages and as a focus for language development. In this program, users build up 30 different pictures in stages by pressing a switch, clicking a mouse, or pressing a key on the keyboard. Users can choose how many presses are needed to complete a picture. Users can also choose different colored backgrounds or no background. Each time the switch/key/mouse is pressed, more of the image is built up. When the picture is complete, the program plays sound and animation, which continue until the switch/key/mouse is pressed again. Users can configure a time delay before a switch press will move on. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows operating system and CD-ROM drive.
