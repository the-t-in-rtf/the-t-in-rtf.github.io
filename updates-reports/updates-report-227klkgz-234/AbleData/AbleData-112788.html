This device provides full mouse control of computers or alternative and augmentative communication devices (AAC), and enables users to control cursor movements through subtle body movements. Tilt-sensor technology is utilized to perform the cursor movements. Operating as a joystick in space, the key to the system is a tiny body sensor, smaller than a postage stamp. The Body sensor is worn by the user literally anywhere from head to toe.  As the sensor is tilted, movement is analyzed by a built-in microcomputer and used to generate proportional cursor movements. It is fully compatible with all hardware and software including click/dwell programs, on-screen keyboards, and other assistive technology products. To operate, connect the microphone, connect, position the body sensor in desired location, and connect USB cable to the host computer. There is no software to install or drivers to load. This cursor device operates in conjunction with all existing mice or other input devices on the computer system. It is portable and compatible with all desktop and notebook computers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers, Macintosh computers, and AAC devices with a USB port.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: All applications require an available USB Port. IBM and compatible computers require Microsoft Windows VISTA, XP, 2000, or ME. Macintosh computers require OSX 8.2 or above. AAC devices require a USB 2.0 Interface. OPTIONS: Replacement USB cables and mounting kit. DIMENSIONS: 3.5 x 1.75 x 0.7 inches. WEIGHT: Less than 2 Ounces (excluding cables). WARRANTY: Full 2 Years with extended warranties available.
