It supports both PowerLinc V2 models, ActiveHome Pro (model CM-15A), and more than 100 other models of gadgets and scores of USB serial adapters. In many cases, it can store the user&#x27;s schedule in a controller so devices can be operated without the computer. The system has built-in speech recognition for voice commands, and provides spoken announcements. A Setup Assistant and Gadget Guide are included, and the Sherlock plug-in can find answers in home automation forums, Wikis, and newsgroups. The system meets INSTEON and X-10 standards. Access is provided for the Web, email, iChat/AOL Instant Messenger, and cell phones, and the system supports scripting with AppleScript and virtually any installed language (unix shell scripts, Python, Perl, etc.). Support is included for the iPhone app, X10 Commander from Melloware, which enables the user to point an iPhone at the Mac to control X-10 and INSTEON devices from a distance. The program is available online or on a CD-ROM. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Mac OS 10.3.9 or later operating system. Non-USB controller models require a USB-serial adapter.
