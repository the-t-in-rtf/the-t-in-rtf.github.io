This iPad application (or app) includes two classic board games - The Game of the Goose and Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders - and is designed to help children learn each game one step at a time. Happy Geese features 24 game chips with cute figures of people and animals and seven different dice with colors, shapes, letters and numbers. The app is intended to help children develop the ability to wait for their turn; learn 24 basic concepts with different dice and boards, including six colors, six shapes, six numbers and six vowels; learn abstraction skills with three different types of chips: people, animals and their own pictures; and learn to stay concentrated and focused. In The Game of the Goose, the parent or teacher can choose between four boards with shapes of increasing difficulty and add challenges one at a time, including dice with colors, shapes, letters and numbers, jumps between geese, bridges between cells, and final cell configuration. In the Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders game, the parent or teacher will be able to choose between four boards with shapes of increasing difficulty, and then combine them with various options, including cells with colors, shapes or letters, a variety of dices, and snakes and ladders. Up to four players can play per round. Available languages are English, Catalan, French and Spanish. OPTIONS: Six additional boards are available as an in-app purchase for $1.99. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.1 or later.
