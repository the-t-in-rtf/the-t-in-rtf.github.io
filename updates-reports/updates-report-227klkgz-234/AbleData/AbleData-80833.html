Standard keyboard features enable it to fuction like a physical keyboard while offering lockable keys and visual and audible feedback. Other features include 60 user selectable button actions (i.e., click, toggle, double click, enter, etc.), an automatic dwell feature which sends a button press after a delay period selected by the user, selection of common suffixes, optional automatic &quot;u&quot; after a &quot;q,&quot; automatic spacing after punctuation, automatic capitalization for new sentences, and an &quot;Undo&quot; feature that reverses the last WordComplete action. WordComplete provides word prediction and automatic word completion. New words are added autimatically to the user-editable word list and list words are sorted by frequency of use. Keystroke macro functions allow the user to build keystroke sequences and assign them to Macro buttons which can be grouped in panels. The user may select the colors for individual macro panels. Automatic screen positioning arranges windows to enable users to complete common tasks efficiently. Selecting &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; mode provides additional feature and control options. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Vista or 7; Windows-compatible pointing device. An older version is available for Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me and NT.
