This application (or app) allows a therapist or parent to use an Apple iPad to help children to learn how to put two or three words together or basic English phrases. It provides many opportunities to hear, see, and say/record 72 different verb / noun combinations. There are 17 simple verbs such as drink, eat, wash, and 12 verb + preposition forms such as jump on, take off or turn on. Each verb form is paired with various nouns to make a logical phrase. By touching the illustrated parts of the phrases in order (verb + object forms: &quot;eat the carrot&quot;), the child hears the pre-recorded spoken phrase modeled. The user has the option to repeat this action once, twice or three times to maximize auditory input. The child then watches the animal of their choice (bear, mouse or cat) perform the command to help associate the words with their meaning. The child can then touch the microphone and record, listen again, and watch the animal follow his/her direction. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
