This application (or app) allows a person to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch as a task organizer or scheduler. The app remembers later what the user does now and gives them recall of completed tasks by confirming completion of routine tasks. It’s Done! can also notify others by text or email when a task is done. The user can select from 40 everyday tasks in the Task Library or create their own tasks. Pre-loaded tasks include: lock back or front door; turn off stove; take morning or evening medication; feed the pet; close garage door; lock the car, and turn off the iron. Tasks can be set up to repeat daily or at scheduled intervals. Each completed task is confirmed with a date/time stamp and stored in the app’s history. The user can un-check a task and mark “done” again with a new date/time stamp for tasks that need to be done multiple times a day. Tasks can be categorized and prioritized according to type and importance. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
