This application (or app) allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad to answer questions such as &quot;Who is your principal?&quot; or &quot;When do you eat lunch?&quot; The program can be viewed in portrait or landscape mode. It includes 56 illustrated picture flash cards, and each card comes with audio of card text. The therapist or teacher selects the cards he or she would like the child to see and has the child asks and answers questions about what happens before, during, and after school. The child looks at an illustration, either reads the prompt or touches the screen to listen to the prompt, and gives a verbal response. The therapist or parent taps the green (correct) or red (incorrect) button to score the child&#x27;s response after each answer, and then moves to the next card by sliding the card being displayed on the screen or moves to the next child by tapping the bar at the top of the screen and selecting a name. The app will advance to the next card or player automatically when the &quot;Auto-Advance&quot; option is selected in the &quot;Game Options&quot; menu. A game can be paused and resumed by selecting &quot;Pause Game&quot; and &quot;Continue Game&quot; at any time. The therapist or teacher can view results in a graph and see which questions the child missed during a session. Each child&#x27;s data can be printed and emailed. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 5.0 or later.
