                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Mac OS X Jaguar is a computer operating system with built-in keyboard modification, mouse emulator, screen magnification, speech synthesizer, visual beep indicator, voice input, and voice output programs, designed for use by individuals who are blind, deaf or hard of hearing, or who have low vision or upper extremity disabilities. For users with low vision, this operating system provides a Zoom display option that uses the Quartz rendering and compositing engine to magnify the contents of the screen while smoothing graphics and type. The operating system also provides a white on black display option. For individuals with upper extremity disabilities or low vision, speech recognition can be used to launch applications as well as to execute application commands instead of typing or mousing. The system will also speak alerts, selected text, and text underneath the mouse using its PlainTalk speech synthesizer program. For users who are deaf or hard of hearing, the operating system makes it possible for the screen to flash to indicate beeping alerts. Users who have have difficulty using the mouse can use the numeric keypad to move the cursor around the screen. The operating system also allows users to navigate menus, the Dock, windows, toolbars, palettes, and other controls via the keyboard. For individuals who have difficulty using a keyboard, the operating system allows modifier keys (command, option, control, shift) to be pressed sequentially instead of simultaneously. The operating system displays key sequences on screen with the Quartz compositor, and can also beep when a modifier key is pressed. OPTIONS: Single-switch and on-screen keyboard software, and command sets to extend command capabilities when using voice recognition software (see separate entries). COMPATIBILITY: For use on Power Mac G3, G4, G4 Cube; iMac; PowerBook G3, G4; iBook; or eMac computers. This operating system does not support the original PowerBook G3 or processor upgrade cards. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 128 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM); built-in display or display connected to an Apple-supplied video card; and at least 3.0 gigabytes (GB) of available hard drive space. This operating system works with most Canon, HP, and Epson USB inkjet printers; USB digital still cameras that support mass storage, PTP, and Digita; and cameras from Canon, Kodak, and Nikon. However, some devices may need additional driver support from the manufacturer.
