The unit fits immediately adjacent to the keyboard or laptop, which places the mousing controls just a few inches below the home keys, keeping the user&#x27;s hands within a small work area and eliminating large reaching motions as the user&#x27;s elbows remain by the user&#x27;s side. The unit is controlled with an unflexed hand, so there is no need to clutch, grasp, or hold the unit in order to navigate the cursor. The user&#x27;s fingertips roll a narrow bar both up and down and from side to side simultaneously to navigate the cursor over the entire screen, with very little friction or resistance. The elimination of finger flexing avoids activity through the carpal tunnel. The mouse buttons are centered beneath the keyboard home keys, so mouse control is equidistant from either hand, encouraging ambidextrous use. The unit has on board drivers with seven button functions and a USB connector. A wrist rest is included. COMPATIBILITY: For use with laptop or desktop Macintosh or personal (PC) computers. DIMENSIONS: 15 x 4.5 inches with wrist rests, 15 x 3 inches without wrist rests. WARRANTY: Return within 30 days for a refund.
