The program comprises 18 tactile storybooks with text that parents can read aloud and tactile illustrations that children who are blind or have low vision can feel. These tactile storybooks contain information and activities to enhance the development of literacy in young children. Giggly-Wiggly, Snickety-Snick has words on the left-hand page that capture a range of tactile experiences such as bumpy, smooth, and crunchy, and envelopes on the right-hand pages that can be filled with the corresponding real objects (not included). Something Special is a story about a child who has lost something, featuring objects fixed to the book pages. That&#x27;s Not My Bear is a story about a child who has lost his teddy bear, featuring fuzzy shapes for the special bear and for the replacements offered by his family. Geraldine&#x27;s Blanket is a story about a girl&#x27;s special blanket and how it wears out over time, with squares of fabric affixed to the pages to show the fate of the blanket. Jennifer&#x27;s Messes features thermoforms (molded plastic shapes) of familiar objects such as breakfast cereals, pretzels, and crayons, illustrating the messes made by Jennifer. Jellybean Jungle is a counting book with rows of one to ten thermoform jellybeans; it comes with scented stickers that can be affixed to the jellybeans. Other books illustrated with thermoforms include Gobs of Gum, a rhyming story about bubblegum; Roly-Poly Man, a story about a child who makes a roly-poly man from clay; and Thingamajig, a story about a child who collects everyday things, such as coins, buttons, and marbles. Storybooks illustrated with raised line drawings include The Longest Noodle, about a child who discovers the world&#x27;s longest noodle; The Blue Balloon, about a balloon that takes on extraordinary shapes and does remarkable things; The Littlest Pumpkin, about a pumpkin that is too small to be a jack-o&#x27;-lantern (the pumpkin is made of foam cutouts); That Terrible, Awful Day, in which a child&#x27;s popsicle disappears as everyone shares a taste; The Caterpillar, in which a blind child finds a caterpillar in the back yard (the caterpillar is made of fuzzy fabric); Silly Squiggles, in which a worm folds itself into various shapes; The Gumdrop Tree, in which a tree grows from a gumdrop and then bears fruit (scented stickers included); Bumpy Rolls Away, in which Bumpy the Ball rolls down a hill, down steps, and along a sidewalk; and Book About Me, with fill-in-the-blank sentences in braille and print and space to add illustrations. Words in each tactile storybook are in large print and braille. OPTIONS: Storybooks are sold separately or in sets with three to ten selected storybooks. An introductory book on reading aloud to children, Let&#x27;s Get Started, is available in a version with both print and braille, and a handbook for parents and teachers on building a foundation for literacy from birth through age five is available in two versions (regular print and cassette tape).
