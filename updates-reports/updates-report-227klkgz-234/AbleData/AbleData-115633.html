The application (or app) allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to improve his or her articulation skills through practicing the production of the /r/ phoneme with a therapist, parent, or independently. The app comes with over 450 target words and uses a phonetic approach to teaching the “r” sound by creating subgroups. The /r/ phoneme at the word level includes: pre-vocalic /r/, /r/ clusters, /rl/, /lr/, /ajer/, /ar/, /er/, /or/, and /?r/. The “Probes” function allows a therapist or parent to probe a child and attempt to indentify a specific environment such as /r/ clusters or /rl/ fon which the child should focus. The therapist or parent can also elect to let the child practice the /r/ phoneme at the phrase level in conjunction with the word level or after the child has mastered the word level. The percentage of accuracy is tallied at the end of each session. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
