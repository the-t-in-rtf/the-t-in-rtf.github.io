This program enables touchscreen pointing device to operate within any Windows program to minimize movement and simplify multi-keystroke actions to a single action. The software includes five different U.S. (including ABCD, DVORAK and QWERTY) and more than175 international keyboards, which appear on the screen in a &quot;Heads-Up&quot; format in 12 different sizes. These keyboards are useful for non-typists, children, multi-lingual users, and companies. Up to 2,000 user-defined macro buttons can be created that store keystroke sequences to up to 15 buttons. These macro functions also allow applications to be launched by and/or have auto-open Macro Panels associated with that particular application. The program also features a four-function calculator with memory and a savable pop-up calculator tape that will place dispayed information into a currently open document or field. In all, the program features more than 125 distinct functions, including a magnifier which enhances the viewing area under the cursor, customized color, and the ability to assign any of 63 different functions to each button on the user&#x27;s pointing device. COMPATIBILITY: For use with computers with Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP.
