The program allows a person to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to scan bar codes and hear the names of the items in four ways. First, the user can record his/her own audio labels by visiting the Digit-Eyes website, printing quick-response (QR) barcode labels, applying the labels to calendar dates or other items, and recording messages to match each label. Digit-Eyes will play a corresponding recording when a label is scanned. Using the second method, the user can make  QR labels on the Digit-Eyes website, each of which has a text label with up to 100 characters, prints the QR barcode labels, applies the labels to file folders or CDs, and Digit-Eyes will read out text associated with the label when it is scanned. A third method allows the user to purchase pre-printed washable cloth labels that can be sewn onto any article of clothing. The labels can be associated with descriptive information each article. Finally, a person can use the app to scan bar codes on products in stores. When the user scans a UPC, EAN or ISBN manufacturer’s barcode, Digit-Eyes looks it up in the software&#x27;s own database and displays the result along with the options to search by Google and to enter the user&#x27;s own description of the item. Available languages include English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. Each device must be equipped with a camera. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
