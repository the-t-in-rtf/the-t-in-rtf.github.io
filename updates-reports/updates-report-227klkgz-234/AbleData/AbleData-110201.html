                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>PDF Equalizer ML is a voice output program for PDF documents, designed for use by individuals who are blind or have low vision or learning disabilities. This program can open files in any PDF version and read them aloud without going through a conversion or import process. Documents can be read continuously, page by page, or by page selection, in English, French, or Spanish. Reading speed is adjustable. The program includes a text-to-audio converter that can convert a single page or a range of pages into MP3 files. So that specific pages can be located, each page is converted to its own audio file and numbered in order. Pages are automatically formatted for easier reading, and can be displayed with inverted colors for high contrast reading. A built-in notes function allows the user to take notes that remain synchronized with the PDF page. This means that notes taken on page 57 are displayed when the user returns to page 57. The notes feature also allows the user to copy images, formulas, charts, and tables from the PDF file into the notes. Notes can be viewed in a single document, which can be printed or saved. Other features include a talking dictionary function; a built-in translator that can translate between English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese; the ability to summarize content automatically; integrated hyperlinks; the ability to load a PDF file directly from a URL; and the ability to work on either a standalone workstation or a network. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 2000, XP, or Vista operating system; 800 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; 256 megabytes (MB) RAM; and 150 MB disk space.
