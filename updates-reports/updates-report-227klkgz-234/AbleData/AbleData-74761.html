This program can be used in conjunction with QualiKey (not included; see entry) and enables users to open new or documents, create documents, and modify, save, print, and delete documents. Users can also create, delete, and modify personal folders to organize documents. Documents can also be faxed directly from the program or sent to mobile phones using the included short message system (SMS). An account with 1,000 free short messages comes with the program. When the speak function is activated, documents are read aloud using QualiSpeak (see entry). Using QualiDict (see entry), documents can be dictated. Documents are also compatible with other QualiWorld applicatios, including QualiPhone and QualiMail (see entries). QualiSet for QualiWorld (included) enables users to personalize and save settings and configurations, including language and font style, color, and size. The program is designed to allow multiple users access a single computer and save configurations. A layout designer enables the user to create, modify, and personalize the keyboard; the user can create as many layouts as needed and they can be loaded as needed or associated with a specific application. Clicking an icon enables the user to switch layouts. The program also offers word prediction with a 20,000 word dictionary in any of the six languages offered. New words are automatically added to the dictionary and a vocabulary editor enables users to add, delete, or modify words. Predicted words can be presented in order of frequency, recent use, or alphabetically. Other features include a sound manager that applies different sounds to keys or types of keys for audible feedback and a repeat key manager that defines the way the repetition of a key is handled when a key is pressed for an extended period. This on-screen keyboard can be accessed using a pointing device such as a mouse, a touch screen, or QualiEye (not included; see entry); auto scanning; manual scanning with one or two switches; or auto click which is generated by the software after the cursor is held in a fixed position. The software, word prediction, on-line help, and the user manual are available in six languages. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium III processor, 300 MegaHertz or higher; Windows 98, 2000, or XP (XP Professional recommended)
