The program consists of four different types of exercises to allow users to practice different aspects of reading skills: read the text and answer questions; read the text in stages, as it is  revealed sentence by sentence; read the text as it disappears at a speed selected by the user in order to work on reading faster; or read the text with selected keywords hidden. At any stage, the user can listen to the text being read. Users can also record themselves reading aloud for later review. Many texts are included on the program CD, and users can add their own. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM or compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows operating system; CD-ROM drive.
