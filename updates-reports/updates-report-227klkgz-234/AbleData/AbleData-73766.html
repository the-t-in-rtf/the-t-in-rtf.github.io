Each volume has two games: Word Blast and Word Jitter in Volume 1, and Word Battle and Word Replica in Volume 2. In Word Blast, the player is presented with a word from a 100,000-word list, and asked to find a new word using only the letters of the original word. As the game continues, the player is given less time to solve the puzzle. In Word Jitter the player is given a scrambled word from a 22,000-word list and asked to unscramble it within a time limit. In Word Battle, the player and the computer each choose a word, then each tries to guess the other&#x27;s word by exchanging one letter at a time. In Word Replica the player scores points by matching words on a hidden list, taking as little time (and making as few mistakes) as possible. Word Battle and Word Replica come with over 100,000 words in their databases. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98 or higher operating system; screen reader.
