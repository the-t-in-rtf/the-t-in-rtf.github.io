A quadriplegic used a computer to organize his activities such as painting, filmmaking, counseling, and motivational speaking. Laptops do not easily mount onto the electric wheelchair, and when the iPad became available, this individual jumped at the chance. Working with TADNSW an iPad bracket was created to be ready for use with the iPad. The wheelchair already had a bracket attached to hold the user’s iPhone, house front gate remote, and a universal remote for the TV and sound systems. After researching the dimensions of the iPad on the Internet a new bracket was designed. Another horizontal bar was attached to the wheelchair. An aluminum base was cut to hold the iPad with a disc underneath so the device could rotate. Strips of Velcro were glued to the supporting base and to the bottom of the iPad case allowing it to sit firmly in position on the base. Since the user has limited control of his arms. he uses a mouthstick to operate both the iPhone and iPad. When the user is not using the mouthstick, it sits within easy reach in a metal tube mounted on the wheelchair. To combat the problem of running out of battery power an iPhone car charger kit is used to connect each device to the wheelchair battery. TITLE: iPad Mount. JOURNAL: TAD Journal.
