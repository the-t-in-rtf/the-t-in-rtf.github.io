These systems scan text or numbers and enable an individual to hear them read out loud in a clear and natural sounding voice. Scan-A-Word is a computer add-on system consisting of a lightweight wand scanner, scanner holder, OCR software, headphones, and installation and product manuals. Scan-A-Word provides reading assistance for individual words or sentences. The user scans books, magazines, or documents with the included hand held portable scanner, which plugs into any computer or laptop, and the words or numbers are read from the computer&#x27;s word processor. Scan-A-Page consists of a full page scanner, software, headphones, and installation and product manuals. Scan-A-Page scans whole pages of text and copies it to the word processor of a connected computer, from which the whole page or any part of the page can be read back. The system is operated with a single button. Both systems will read any words that are on the computer screen such as an Internet web page, Email and any other application. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium PC, sound card, 64 megabytes of RAM memory, and 40-400 megabytes of free hard drive space.
