The program also reinforces shape recall and helps children develop skills relating to code-breaking, mathematics, language, and problem solving. The school versions and above also come with freely reproducible lesson plans and manipulative masters. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: Windows or Macintosh.
