This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use an Apple iPad to help children accomplish the following educational goals: (1) improve paragraph formation; (2) improve integration of ideas; and (3) improve higher level abstractions by inference. The record feature allows a child to record a narrative in his or her own voice by responding to a series of pre-recorded questions. Recorded answers are stitched together to create complete narrative. Three different levels of play are available. Story Builder comes with 500 audio clips of questions to guide a narrative and 50 distinct story lines from which to create a narrative. Stories can be emailed and archived for later use. The app supports multiple users, and each user gets a separate archive page. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later.
