These audio card sets are designed to work with audio card readers such as The PCI Communicator or the Language Master (see separate entries) to allow students to work at their own pace to acquire reading and language skills through interactive learning. These cards use a multi-sensory approach to reinforce basic skills. Students listen to the card and look at the corresponding full-color labeled illustration, record a response on the same card, and compare the response with the original recording. Each sequentially-numbered card comes unrecorded, enabling the teacher to provide a familiar voice for the student. Picture Word Fundamentals ($65) includes 72 cards covering familiar, high frequency Dolch List words from A to Z. Readiness Fundamentals ($70) includes 50 cards covering eight colors, six shapes, the numbers 1 through 10, and the 26 letters of the alphabet; teacher resource materials; four overhead transparancies; and four reproducible worksheets. Phonics Fundamentals ($75) includes 86 cards covering final consonants, vowels, and consonant vowel diagraphs; teacher resource materials, four overhead transparencies; and four reproducible worksheets.
