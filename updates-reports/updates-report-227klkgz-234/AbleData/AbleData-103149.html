                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>WriteOnline is a voice output word processor program, word prediction program and on-screen keyboard program designed for individuals at all ability levels, including people with learning disabilities, dyslexia, low vision, or cognitive disabilities. It has a wide range of accessibility options for users who cannot use a mouse or keyboard, including individuals with upper extremity disabilities or spinal cord injury. The user can install the program from CD or access the program over the Internet by logging. When using WriteOnline, the user can select between several on-screen keyboard layouts with letters or whole words. The user can click on these words to send the corresponding word to a document in the word processor. The user can also type text into the word processor using an actual keyboard. The program reads text aloud by letter, by word, or by sentence as it is entered. Documents can be saved locally or to the user’s personal online folders. Wordflow word prediction is initiated when the user begins typing and SoundsLike technology detects what the word being typed sounds like. The Wordbar function gives the user instant point-and-click access to specific words and phrases. WriteOnline also allows the user to create their own Wordbar. The WorkSpace function enables the user to create visual mind maps and diagrams, and organize his or her thoughts and ideas in diagrammatic format before starting to write. The document analysis tool allows a teacher to track a student’s writing progress. The program also works with a switch or with the Mouse Dwell option for users who are unable to use a keyboard or a mouse. The Mouse Dwell function allows the user to enter text by hovering the mouse pointer over the required cell. The program can be operated with between one and four switches and with a variety of scanning methods. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM compatible computers, Windows XP, Vista, or 7 operating system. For Mac computers, Mac OS X 10.5 or 10.6 operating system. Internet connection and Java are required for online version.
