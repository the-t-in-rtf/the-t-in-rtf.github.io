This application (or app) is an interactive game that includes over 350 words and 12 categories of words, including shapes, numbers, food, feelings, clothes, and animals. The app can be used to help children develop fine motor control, letter recognition, phonemic awareness, and word recognition. The Word List Management feature allows the user to choose which categories of words to be shown to students and to hide words lists that he or she does not want the students to see. The Word Management feature allows the user to choose which words (shorter words, longer words, or words with particular letter combinations) to include in each word list and to hide words that a child may find distracting. Other features include phonics or letter names; uppercase, lowercase, or capitalized words; serif or sans-serif font; and slow or quick word spelling speed. The interface has been tested with toddlers and young children and is designed specifically for little fingers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
