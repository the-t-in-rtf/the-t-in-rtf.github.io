This application (or &quot;app&quot;) is designed for use with the Apple iPad to teach important topics necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Developed with the Westchester Institute for Human Development (WIHD), this program is designed to be used directly by users with special needs to learn about healthy living in a self-directed manner or as part of a group learning activity facilitated by an instructor using the included trainer&#x27;s manual. The user learns to make healthy choices in daily life and to speak up for good health. This training program includes eight sessions and topics covered include: Taking Charge of Your Health; Develop a Health Plan; Be a Health Self-Advocate; Get Moving; Eat Right; Be Healthy at Home; Feel Good About Yourself and Others; and Stay on Track. The user watches a video covering the selected health topic with each session, reviews &quot;Things to Remember&quot; using the AbleLink Instructional Media Standard (AIMS) multimedia training system, and completes a short survey to test their knowledge using AbleLink&#x27;s ATLAS cognitively accessible testing system. Three additional health tools are available online for use with the program: My Medical Appointment (a form to help the user prepare for medical appointments); Health Information Form (a record of a person&#x27;s health needs and medical history); and My Health Plan (a listing of goals developed during the seminar). COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later.
