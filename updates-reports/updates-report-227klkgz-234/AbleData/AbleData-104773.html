It does so through two activities:
                                The first activity, Tilt It, uses kinesthetic learning to teach left from right. According to research, a key reason for letter reversals is not knowing left from right, and as a result, children get confused when trying to discriminate between a “b” and a “d” or a “p” and a “q”. They are not quite sure which side the letter loop should go on. With Tilt It, children will learn the correct position of letter loops by being challenged to tilt the device in the correct direction to form letters.
                                The second activity, Flip It, allows children to practice what they learned while honing their letter discrimination skills. Using arcade game action, Flip It challenges kids to visually discriminate and manipulate letters and words to match the correct orientation. The activity will help hone their visual discrimination skills and further cement their knowledge of correct letter and word formation.
                                The app includes an automatic tracking and reporting feature, making it easier for parents, teachers and therapists to identify time spent on task, accuracy, and progress. These reports can be e-mailed right from the app.
