This voice recognition application allows hands-free operation of an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. The program allows the user to speak and instantly see the text of what is said appear in the document, email message, or other input area. The user launches Dragon Dictation, taps the red recording button in the middle of the screen, and starts speaking the content to be typed. When the user finishes speaking the text to be added, he/she taps the “Done” button (for iPhone and iPod Touch) or anywhere on the screen (for iPad). Dragon Dictation also offers the option of typing the message by tapping the keyboard icon instead of speaking. The user can edit transcribed text by tapping the word he/she would like to correct and a drop-down list of alternative suggestions will appear for from which the user can choose. Dictated text is automatically saved in Dragon Dictation Notes; and the user can review, edit and delete existing notes as well as create new notes. Composed messages can be sent as emails or text messages, copied to the device’s clipboard or submitted as updates to Twitter and Facebook applications. Dragon Dictation also allows the user to switch from English to another language. Available languages include English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.0 or later.
