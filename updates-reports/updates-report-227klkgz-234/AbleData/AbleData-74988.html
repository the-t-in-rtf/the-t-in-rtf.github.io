This program is designed for early language development and switch training. The program contains 45 line drawings of everyday objects, animals, and vehicles. Users can choose to color all or some of these images with one switch press or several. Coloring is accompanied with sound effects and a final sound reward. A second option allows the picture to be partially hidden by a cloud while users try to identify it. The first switch press gives a sound clue, and the second reveals the picture. The program is designed to be as flexible as possible and is fully configurable as to which activity is presented, which control buttons are displayed for the user, how sound effects are used, and the length of pause between actions. The program can be accessed from a keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, overlay keyboard, or one, two, three, or five switches. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows operating system and CD-ROM drive.
