This synthesizer works in conjunction with a screen reader program and a sound card (not included). The software allows multiple languages to be spoken in nine voices, which can be adjusted for volume, speed, and pitch.  PortSpeak remembers the last voice settings, and re-loads them each time the program is started. To reduce the pronounciation errors that can occur with speech synthesizers, PortSpeak uses a technology called GRABS (Grammatical Read Ahead Before Speaking), which reads the text in advance of speaking in order to decide if a word is a noun, verb, adverb, adjective, past participle, or abbreviation. the software uses this information to decide which is the correct pronounciation to send to the sound card. PortSpeak correctly identifies different pronunciations needed for telephone numbers, dates, time, and ordinal numbers. When dealing with currencies, the program will pronounce the currency symbol in the correct order in relation to the amount. A document reader that allows a full document to be read is included. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95/98/NT, and a screen reader program that has incorporated the Portset API or that has an SSIL interface.
