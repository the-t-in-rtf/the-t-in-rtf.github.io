                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>BigKeys Plus is a modified computer keyboard designed for use by children and adults with manual dexterity disabilities or low vision to locate and hit the keys. This keyboard features a choice of large brightly colored keys with enlarged black labels or white keys with enlarged black labels. The colored keys are color-coded to coincide with the letters; for example, all vowels are in yellow, the &quot;R&quot; is in red, and the &quot;G&quot; is in green, etc. This accelerates recognition of letters and the child&#x27;s progress in learining to read. The arrow keys are also enlarged and the four keys are configured in a diamond shape which, in addition to the bold arrows on them, contributes to indicating the direction in which the cursor will move. The individual click-style keys are laid out in a choice of alphabetical order or the standard QWERTY layout and feature UV coated keycap printing. Also included on the keyboard are escape, control, and Alt keys; caps lock; shift key; tab; a back space function; and a delete key. Depressing the &quot;F&quot; key in conjunction with a number key (1 through 10) provides standard function key capability. The keyboard also includes punctuation keys, arithmetic keys, and Internet keys. Instant plug-and-play technology eliminates the need for setting up and the keyboard does not require special software. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible or Macintosh computers. OPTIONS: USB adaptor. DIMENSIONS: The keys are one-inch square. COLOR: Gray casing with multi-colored keys in yellow, blue, white, red, and green (control keys are light gray) or gray casing with white keys. All keytop printing is black. WARRANTY: One-year replacement warranty.
