It can also be used in the workplace or in other venues in which meetings are held. The MimioPad is designed to be used with the MimioTeach electronic whiteboard (not included). The unit connects wirelessly to the MimioTeach whiteboard, allowing the teacher to move around the classroom while presenting information on the whiteboard, and the MimioPad can be passed to any student to allow that student to post information on the board. The MimioPad includes an RF wireless interface and a USB cable, either of which can be used to connects it to a computer running MimioStudio software (included), through which the MimioPad connects to the MimioTeach board. The wireless interface has a range of up to 30 feet. A stylus (included) is used to write, point, and click on the tablet. Multiple tablets can be connected to one computer, and students can take turns using a unit to interact with the whiteboard without leaving their seats. The unit is lightweight and portable, and it is shaped to fit in the user&#x27;s hand. Shortcut keys on the unit&#x27;s screen provide access to MimioStudio software tools. DIMENSIONS (HxWxD): 11.5 x 11 x 0.5 inches. POWER: Rechargeable 3.7-Volt, 700 milliampere-hour lithium-ion battery that offers up to 16 hours of continuous use. WEIGHT: 1.02 pounds with battery. COMPATABILITY: For use on Apple Macintosh or IBM PC or compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (for MimioStudio):  Windows XP, Vista, or 7 with  at least a Pentium II 750 MHz processor or equivalent, 512 megabytes (MB) RAM minimum (1 gigabyte [GB] RAM recommended), 350 MB (English)or  800 MB (multi-language) free disk space, CD/DVD ROM drive or Internet connection; Mac OS 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7 with Intel 1 or greater GHz processor , 512 MB RAM minimum (1 GB recommended), 350 MB (English)or  900 MB (multi-language) free disk space, CD/DVD ROM drive or Internet connection; Linux Fedora 13, 14, openSUSE 11.3, or Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04 on a PC with 512 MB RAM minimum (1 GB RAM recommended), 500 MB (English) or 1 GB (Multi-language) free disk space, and CD/DVD ROM drive or Internet connection.
