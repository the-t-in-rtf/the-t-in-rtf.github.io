The user interface is accessible to blind and visually impaired users. The software is available on a CD-ROM (model D-03600-00) or through electronic distribution (model D-03600-ED). COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, or later operating system; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM; Windows compatible sound card and speakers;
                                5 MB hard disk space for program installation; and a minimum of twice as much free hard disk space as the total size of the files which are to be edited at one time.
