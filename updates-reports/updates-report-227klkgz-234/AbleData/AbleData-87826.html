Two separate programs are available: The Holidays Coloring Book offers more than a dozen pictures depicting major holidays, including Halloween, the 4th of July, Christmas, Hanukkah, and more. Each picture includes its own overlay and the set also includes two clear template overlays. The Animals Coloring Book offers more than a dozen pictures of familiar animals such as alligators, gorillas, lions, and sharks. Each picture includes its own overlay and two clear template overlays are also included. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh systems. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Runs on any Macintosh system with a hard drive and a color monitor; System 6.0.7 or higher and 1 megabbyte (MB) RAM are required.
