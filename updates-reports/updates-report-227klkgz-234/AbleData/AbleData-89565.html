DINO-DOT is a collection of sot-to-sot games which enhance number concepts, counting, sequencing skills, and spacial perception. Games can be selected using patterns of three, six, nine or twelve dots. The mode of play, difficulty level, auditory feedback and scan speed can be controlled manually. DINO-FIND is a game of concentration that stimulates memory and pattern recognition and provides scanning practice. The dinosaurs are selected randomly and one to six matching pairs can be displayed. DINO-MAZE provides a series of colorful, motivation exercises where dinosaur characters move through mazes to reach goals with reinforcement through music and animation. Single-switch users can choose between cause and effect activities or games that involve decisions about which direction the animated characters should go. DINO-LIKE is a matching game. Single-switch users select a dinosaurs that are identical to the target dinosaur. The discrimination level can be set manuallly choosing a match and two distractors, a match and one distractor, or the match alone. Color shape and orientation of dinosaurs are used to enhance pattern matching skills. COMPATIBILITY: Works with IBM and compatibles and Macintosh. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Macs need System 7 or higher. PCs need DOS 3.3+, VGA graphics and a serial port.
