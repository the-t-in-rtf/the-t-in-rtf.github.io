It is useful for teaching reading skills to students who have difficulty with phonics or oral language, or who have impulsive learning styles. It is also effective for teaching English as a second language. The program uses speech output, graphics, and animation. Over-learning of the non-content words (such as &quot;the,&quot; &quot;is,&quot; and &quot;here&quot;) is emphasized; however, equal attention is given to content words. Scan speed and response time are adjustable. A lesson summary of each activity may be read on-screen or printed. Each level consists of eight stories, each with its own workbook and reproducible Story Booklet with written exercises. Each story includes Word Recognition, Sequential Recognition, Spelling, and Sentence Completion. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB) RAM; a Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD drive.  The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB application RAM; and a 4x speed CD-ROM.
