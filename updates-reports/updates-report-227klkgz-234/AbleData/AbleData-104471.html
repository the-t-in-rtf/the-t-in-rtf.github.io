For many sufferers of aphasia, a disorder caused by stroke that impairs the language centers of the brain, writing or typing emails may become difficult. When Chad Rubles&#x27;s mother had a stroke that resulted in aphasia, he developed an email interface system based on the Microsoft Kinect&#x27;s approach, using simple hand gestures to select items on the computer&#x27;s screen. The user interface consists of a virtual dashboard, featuring nine emoticons, a series of level or intensity buttons, and a green arrow and a red &quot;X.&quot; The user selects one of the emoticons that reflect his or her current emotional state and uses the intensity buttons to indicate the level at which he or she feels that emotion, before generating and sending the email with the arrow. The red button allows the user to refresh the dashboard. This prototype can make a huge difference in communicating with friends, family, and loved ones for individuals with aphasia or other communication disorders. Rubles intends to develop the system to create more buttons and &quot;pages&quot; to expand the digital vocabulary, such as buttons for what a person is thinking about, or the ability to take a snapshot of oneself using the Kinect camera and link that feature to an online account, without compromising the simplicity of the interface.
