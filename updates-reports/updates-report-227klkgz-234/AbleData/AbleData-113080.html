This program embeds auditory and visual resources within a publisher&#x27;s content to improve retention, comprehension, and recall. Text can be read aloud continuously or by word, sentence, or paragraph, with dual color synchronous highlighting of text that is being read aloud; for example, highlighting a sentence in one color while highlighting each word individually as it spoken in a second color. Publisher&#x27;s material is presented online with timecoding to protect copyright. Students can control playback speed and voice selection. The program is scalable to meet high demand situations with audio and timecode caching for repeat playback. The program can be integrated into most web- based Flash, JAVA or HTML applications, with customizable options for the publisher. Students can access material using a personal computer (PC) or Macintosh (Mac) on all common browsers, including Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. Selected text can be converted to a time coded MP3 file for download to an MP3 player. Other features students can use include a dictionary, word translation, a Fact Finder research tool, Study Skills with extractable annotations, and Sticky Notes.
