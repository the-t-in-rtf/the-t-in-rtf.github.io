The program allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to learn the letters of the alphabet and the sounds that the letters make. The child starts playing the app by pressing PLAY from the Main Menu and a keyboard appears with the letters A through Z displayed on keys in both upper and lower case. Free and structured modes of play are available. When a letter is pressed in the free play mode, a letter and word panel appears, followed by an animation. The child presses the letters to find their favorite words through this discovery method. The user learns by prompted direction in the structured mode. Letters appear at the bottom of the screen and the child is asked to press a particular letter. An animation is produced when the correct letter is pressed. When an incorrect letter is pressed, the app highlights the correct letter and moves along to the next choice. Available languages are English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
