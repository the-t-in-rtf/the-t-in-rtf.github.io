Each storybook includes three skill building activities that develop comprehension, thinking, vocabulary, and sequencing ability. Express It allows the children to write letters to their favorite storybook characters by filling in the missing words, and then they receive a personal response. Story Match lets the children build their vocabulary and thinking skills by matching key words from the stories to colorful pictures. Story Order is where the children develop recall of the story and challenge their memory of the sequence of events by putting key story events in the correct order.
