Created by an collaboration between a team of clinicians at the MDA clinic at Children’s Hospital in Birmingham, AL and the design firm PUSH Product Design; the Locabulary application transforms the iPhone into an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device by making groups of words available to the user depending on their location at the time. Locabulary allows users to construct sentences by manipulating the touch screen on their iPhone to select from menus of location-specific words. The phone then speaks the selected words. The Locabulary features two different text sizes; a quick-phrase list containing general conversation words; an assistance list that allows users to ask for help; a moods list permitting users to broadcast their current mood status; and is compatible with iPhone and iPod Touch (older versions of iPod do not have external speakers, but they can be added through the headphone jack). In the future, designers are working on a “Locabulary Lite” to be offered as an improvement to the original and still free. TITLE: Pocket-sized ACC: Locabulary lets your iPhone talk for you.
