This software enables a touch screen Windows or Apple Macintosh computer to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The user can communicate with others by touching graphical buttons on the screen to speak words or compose sentences. Endeavor Talker comes with over 1000 pre-built buttons for common words and phrases, templates in the button library, and either male or female voice. Drag-and-drop page layouts can be configured to have as few as one large communication button or as many as 50 buttons on a page. The user can create personalized page layouts with buttons and images from the included SymbolStix image library, create new Talker buttons by dragging images directly from Google Images or from his or her own image library, and change the color of any page or add any wallpaper to the page background. The user can also record his or her own words or phrases to be spoken using digitized speech, or use text-to-speech to generate speech. Voice speed is adjustable, and buttons can be set to speak immediately when touched or after the user has composed a phrase or sentence. The user&#x27;s communication patterns can be analyzed with CSV file logging of all button presses. OPTION: Endeavor Talker SmartLife Service. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers with a touch screen. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows Vista or higher or Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or higher; AMD Athlon+ or Intel Core series processor; 1 gigabyte (GB) or higher RAM; 200 megabytes (MB) or more of free hard disk space.
