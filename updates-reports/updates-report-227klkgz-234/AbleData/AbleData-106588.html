Skills introduced in this activity include the following: eye-hand coordination, scanning, matching, sequencing and sorting. In many of the activities, the user controls a life-like hand to complete tasks such as picking up colored pegs and placing them in their matching colored slots.
                                In the example of the pegboard, the hand will hover over the pegboard. If the hand is over a peg, pressing the switch will pick up the peg. If the hand is holding a peg and a switch is pressed, it will put the peg down.
                                The program is composed of the following 27 tasks that involve sorting, matching, sequencing, and vocational themes.
