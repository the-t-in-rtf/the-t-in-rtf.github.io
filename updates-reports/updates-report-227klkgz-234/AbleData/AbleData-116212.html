                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

The gesture-to-voice synthesizer was created at the University of British Columbia by a team led by professor of electrical and computer engineering Sidney Fels. It allows users to put on a pair of sensor-equipped gloves, then move their hands in the air. Based on those hand movements, the synthesizer is able to create audible speech. The gloves contain three-dimensional position sensors, which are able to identify each hand&#x27;s position in space, along with the gestures those hands are making. This information is transmitted to a computer with software that has assigned a different sound to each glove posture. The right-hand glove can detect bending motions and is thus able to produce a variety of consonant sounds when the hand closes and vowel sounds when it opens. Different consonants can be selected between by making different gestures with that hand, while vowel sounds can be controlled by its horizontal location. The glove&#x27;s vertical location controls pitch. Hard stop sounds, such as the consonants &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D,&quot; are produced by gesturing with the left-hand glove. AUTHOR: Ben Coxworth.
