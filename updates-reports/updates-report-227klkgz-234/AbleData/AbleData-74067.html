                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Keystrokes 3 is an on-screen keyboard program designed for use by individuals with fine motor, upper extremity, neurological, and severe physical disabilities or spinal cord injury. It is a virtual on-screen keyboard program that allows the user to type with a mouse, trackball, head pointer, or other mouse emulator to enter characters into any standard Macintosh application. The program provides multilingual word prediction, including word completion, next word prediction, and multi-word prediction in any Roman language and other languages. Dictionaries can be edited, and new dictionaries can be added for additional languages or dialects. The program learns the user&#x27;s vocabulary as the user types or through text files; on Mac OS X learned text can be spell-checked automatically to prevent learning typos. For those who can position a pointer, but not click the mouse buttons, a dwell utility allows mouse button clicks to be entered by holding the cursor motionless for a programmable period of time. The on-screen keyboard floats above other applications, and can be automatically shown and hidden as needed. The program provides visual and audio feedback, including voice output for text entered in English, configurable auto-spacing and auto-capitalization features for a number of languages, and various key designs, selectable font, and adjustable key spacing. The program works with US and international keyboard layouts and includes five interactively resizable keyboard models. A Simple Mode is available to limit a student&#x27;s access to more advanced features. OPTIONS: Also available in French. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Mac OS 9 or higher or Mac OS X 10.1.3 or higher (OS X 10.2 recommended); minimum 800 x 600 pixel screen resolution; 10 megabytes (MB) of free memory. The program comes with a copy of an earlier version, KeyStrokes 2.2, for use on older machines running Mac OS 7.1 and up.
