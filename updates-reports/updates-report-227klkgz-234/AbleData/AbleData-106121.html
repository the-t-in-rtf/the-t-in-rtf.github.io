It uses a combined structure of phonics linked with language, writing skills and vocabulary development, to create multisensory learning. Nessy enables all abilities to read, write and spell with confidence. Nessy is ideal for teachers who need to provide a complete literacy scheme for students with dyslexia. The extensive resources are organized into 10 color-coded islands, which progress from letter sounds to advanced multi-syllabic words.
                                The program integrates planning, group monitoring, record keeping and assessments. Teachers are guided with lesson plans, teaching tips and strategies for learning. Students are encouraged to mark their own work and take on more responsibility for their own learning, playing games, watching rules and completing interactive worksheets. Their efforts are rewarded with Nessy Nuggets, which can be used at an interactive fairground.
                                COLOR: Multiple Colors.
                                WARRANTY/GUARANTEE: As stated by the manufacturer.
