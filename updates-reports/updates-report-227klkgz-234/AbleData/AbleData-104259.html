The stand comes in two sizes - short and tall - and with or without a counter-weighted, microphone-style boom. The short version with the boom is for people that are on the floor and unable to stand or sit up. This version positions the tablet up to 30 inches up from the floor, or all the way down right next to it. The tall version with the boom is for people seated in a wheelchair, stroller, chair, or in bed. The tall version positions the tablet between 36 and 72 inches from the floor. The straight version has no boom and is available in both short and tall sizes. That version positions the tablet 15 inches (short) or between 32 and 60 inches (tall) from the floor. Each stand features a tripod base to prevent tipping. OPTIONS: Tripod locking wheels and 6-inch extension. DIMENSIONS: Base has a diameter of 22 inches (short) or 34 inches (tall). COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad or other tablet computers. WEIGHT: 7 pounds.
