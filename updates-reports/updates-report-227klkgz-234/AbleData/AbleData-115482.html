This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to teach a child or student to talk about things rather than just labeling them. The app contains over 90 images. The child or student is asked in mixed and varied phrases to identify 30 different features of items, objects and people. Features may include: doors, wheels, tails and ears. For example, a flash card displaying a tree, a hot air balloon and a stop sign will be shown on the screen; the app will ask “Where is the one that is flat”; and the correct answer is a stop sign. Flash cards can be shown in order or shuffled. Sound can be turned off, and the app can be used by both visual and auditory learners. COMPATIBILTY: For use with the Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 2.2.1 or later.
