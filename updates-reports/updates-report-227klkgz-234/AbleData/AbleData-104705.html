This app can help users convey messages to those around them by pronouncing phrases and words when the user selects or types in the text.
                                MyVoiceX provides users with several buttons that have already been assigned basic words, such as &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Maybe,&quot; &quot;Hello&quot; or &quot;Goodbye.&quot; The program also contains three categories of preset phrases, namely “Medical,” “Requests” and “Miscellaneous,” enabling users to quickly convey important messages to other people including caregivers. The “Medical” section of preset statements contains various bits of text, such as “I need my medication,” “Call 911,” “I need a doctor” or “I feel ill.” In the “Requests” category, users can find phrases such as “I am too cold,” “I need a bath or a shower,” “I need a change of clothes” or “I am ready for bed.” The “Miscellaneous” section enables users to communicate “Thank you,” “You&#x27;re welcome,” “Please,” “I would like to go out to eat” or “I would like to go to a movie.”
                                Aside from the pre-programmed basic sentences, MyVoiceX also allows users to create and save their own phrases or even whole pages of text, which they can place in one of the five “Speak” areas and pronounce them when required.
