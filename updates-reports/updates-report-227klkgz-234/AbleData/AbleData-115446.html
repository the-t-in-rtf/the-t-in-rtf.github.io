The system operates through the user&#x27;s cell phone or other mobile devices or Web portals. The three components of the system are real-time patient coaching, expert system tools, and decision support tools. Patient coaching tools include testing and medication reminders, metabolic target ranges, out-of-bounds alert, and caregiver alerts and support. Expert system tools include evidence based guidelines, event/alert tracking, predictive modeling, and longitudinal tracking. Decision support tools provide outcomes-based support for case and population management, with clinical analysis and trends, multi-disease platform management, and patient stratification and prioritization. Wireless services include speech-to-text data capture, geo-location-based services, and social and peer-to-peer networks. WellDoc&#x27;s modular platform can be configured to support health environments ranging from medication adherence to complex multi-disease management. The system provides secure information access for the patient, case worker, educator, physician, nurse, and other stakeholders. COMPATIBILITY: Uses more than 200 commercially available cell phone models and all major cellular networks in the United States and elsewhere; computer-based web browsers; cable set top boxes; pocket PCs; or hybrid medical-communication devices. Additionally, the system is compatible with medical devices such as blood glucose meters or blood pressure cuffs that are used in conjunction with the cell phone or web portal. The system can also be integrated with clinicians&#x27; existing EMR or other population management tools.
