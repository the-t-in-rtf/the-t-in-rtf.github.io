                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>The DAESSY Mini Folding Mount, model M75-FM, is a stand for a tablet computer, switch mounting hardware and a computer and communicator mounting kit for wheelchair designed for use by individuals with use of only one hand, or mobility, lower extremity or upper extremity disabilities, or spinal cord injury. The mount is non-directional and can be installed on either side of the wheelchair. The system folds the horizontal tube down to the outside. The folding joint between the two mount tubes brings the tubes parallel by performing a two-step folding sequence. The system can be folded and removed from the wheelchair for storage. The frame clamp assembly includes an inner piece and a removable receiver. The inner piece is bolted or clamped to the wheelchair frame while the receiver holds a vertical tube. The mounted device is attached either directly or with a specific adapter to a quick release plate, and attached to the horizontal tube of the mount assembly by a quick release base that secures the device and allows for quick detaching of the device from the mount. The complete mount can be lifted out of the receiver and removed from the wheelchair leaving only the frame clamp assembly attached to the wheelchair frame, and swung away when the adjustable height clamp lock handle is loosened. DIMENSIONS: Standard configuration dimensions: 14 inches (horizontal tube) and 24 x 6 inches (S-curve side tube). Optional tubes: 16 or 18 inches (horizontal tube); 20 x 3, 24 x 3, 28 x 3, 32 x 3, 20 x 6, 28 x 6, 32 x 6 inches (S-curve side tube). CAPACITY: 10 pounds.
