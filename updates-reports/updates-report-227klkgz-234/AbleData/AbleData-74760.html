This virtual keyboard enables users to type data directly into Windows applications, run and close applications, manage tasks, manage the start menu and shut down the computer, check on-line help and more. This progran can be fully customized to maximize and speed up the user&#x27;s ability to input commands and text. QualiSet for QualiKey (included) enables users to personalize and save settings and configurations. The program is designed to allow multiple users access a single computer and save configurations. A layout designer enables the user to create, modify, and personalize the keyboard; the user can create as many layouts as needed and they can be loaded as needed or associated with a specific application. Clicking an icon enables the user to switch layouts. The program also offers word prediction with a 20,000 word dictionary in any of the six languages offered. New words are automatically added to the dictionary and a vocabulary editor enables users to add, delete, or modify words. Predicted words can be presented in order of frequency, recent use, or alphabetically. Other features include a sound manager that applies different sounds to keys or types of keys for audible feedback and a repeat key manager that defines the way the repetition of a key is handled when a key is pressed for an extended period. This on-screen keyboard can be accessed using a pointing device such as a mouse, a touch screen, or QualiEye (not included; see entry); auto scanning; manual scanning with one or two switches; or auto click which is generated by the software after the cursor is held in a fixed position. The software, word prediction, on-line help, and the user manual are available in six languages. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium III processor, 300 MegaHertz or higher; Windows 98, 2000, or XP (XP Professional recommended).
