                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Boost Tracer is a head-controlled mouse emulator designed for use by individuals with spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, ALS, carpal tunnel syndrome, or any other disability where the user lacks the hand control to use a standard mouse but retains good head movement. A micro-gyroscope senses the user&#x27;s head movements, then transmits those movements to the computer using radio frequency (RF) waves, with an operating range of up to 15 feet. Custom switches can be plugged into its two standard 1/8-inch mono adaptor ports to allow left and right click buttons to communicate through the same RF connection. Up to seven different units can be used in the same work area without interference, false clicks, or crossed signals. This unit is ready to use right out of the box by plugging it in. It comes with a gyroscopic visor, a radio transmitter that doubles as a desktop mouse, and a receiver that
                                also serves as the recharge cradle. POWER: Uses replaceable, internal rechargeable NiMH battery or alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) adaptor. An optional supplemental battery and charger are available. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM PS2, PC/AT, and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: MS-DOS 3.x, Windows 3.1/95/98/NT/2000, or Mac OS 8 or later. Older (pre-USB) Macs with only an ADB port required for load-once-only software to configure the functions of the left and right mouse buttons. DIMENSIONS (HxLxW): Receiver is 2.7 x 5.5 x 2.6 inches. Transmitter is 1.7 x 6.7 x 2.2 inches. Visor is 2 x 8.5 x 5.5 inches. Visor-transmitter cable length is 6 feet. WEIGHT: The receiver weighs 6 ounces, the transmitter weighs 7 ounces, and the visor weighs 5 ounces.
