The program allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to practice sounds in words and sentences with a therapist, parent, or independently. The program can be used to collect scores in flashcards on up to four children at a time and contains 21 decks with 40 cards each (except the r deck, which has 113 cards) for 913 total cards.  The cards teach the following sounds: th, f, v, ch, sh, k, g, s, z, l, r, s-blends, l-blends, p, b, m, n, t, d, and j. The decks are combined, selected for sound group, then practiced in full-featured flash card and matching activities. In the flash card activity, the sound groups are ordered and configured for shuffling to individualize practice for children with both the words alone and in sentences. In the matching activity, the words are randomized in three levels: easy (three pairs), medium (6 pairs), and hard (10 pairs). Other features include: color-coded cards, auto-play of audio recordings, tap-to-play audio, voice recording and playing, data saving organized by names and timestamps, and data copy to clipboard/email. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
