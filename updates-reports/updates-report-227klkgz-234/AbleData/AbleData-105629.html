Once the Interact-AS software is downloaded and installed in the user’s computer/laptop/tablet, the user can start receiving captions of what the other person is saying while he or she is saying it - all without an internet connection. The top portion of the interface will display the most recently spoken phrase, while the bottom portion will display a complete running transcript of the entire conversation. In addition to displaying real-time captioning, Interact-AS can also generate speech and read aloud whatever the user types, writes or swipes.
                                Interact-AS comes in two editions: Professional and Consumer. The Consumer Edition, a scaled down version of the Professional Edition, is ideal for those who need to communicate with only a few people at a time. Those who need to communicate with multiple people and access the full featured communication system should consider the Professional Edition (please see separate entry).
                                Features of the Interact-AS Communication Suite Consumer Edition:
                                 Uses Microsoft’s speech recognition and voice synthesis engines.
                                 Allows up to three accounts.
                                 Supports written, typed and spoken input.
                                 Transcribes and displays spoken words instantly.
                                Allows users to save the transcript in multiple formats (e.g., as a Word document, a Google Doc, etc.).
                                 Provides an optional synchronized audio recording of the transcript.
                                 Speaks aloud written or typed words instantly so a nonverbal person can participate in discussions.
                                 Provides a Visualize feature so users can sketch ideas or make notations on pictures.
                                Interact-AS comes with a noise cancelling microphone, and free upgrades and technical support for the first year of purchase.
                                System Requirements:
                                 PC with Microsoft’s Windows Vista or newer operating system.
                                1 GB or more of RAM.
                                 1.8 GHz or faster CPU (an Intel i5 or faster CPU is recommended)
                                 At least 500K available disk space.
