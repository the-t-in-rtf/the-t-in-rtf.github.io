It is designed for single switch cause &amp;amp; effect users that are ready to move to the next level. The program is comprised of 21 activities grouped into 7 lessons. The activities are in the form of fun filled graphical games where the lesson concepts are embedded. The activities are purely graphical and do not require any reading ability. The program also contains options which allow you to customize the animation speed, audio and visual switch prompt, and background music. Each lesson moves the student a step closer to achieving step scanning. As an added feature, the program comes with a PDF file of switch overlays to help the student understand the function of each of the switches.
                                Level 1 - Single Switch Cause &amp;amp; Effect (A prerequisite for step scanning).
                                Level 2 - Two Switches Operating Independently.
                                Level 3 - Two Switches with Interaction Between Switches.
                                Level 4 - Go Get It by Step Scanning.
                                Level 5 - Errorless Step Scanning.
                                Level 6 - Purposeful Step Scanning.
                                Level 7 - Purposeful Step Scanning Games.
                                SIZES: 35 meg hard disk space.
                                DIMENSIONS (HxLxW): Minimum 1024x768 screen resolution.
                                CAPACITY: User capacity. Spell out measurements.
                                COLOR: Multiple colors.
                                WARRANTY/GUARANTEE: As stated by the manufacturer.
