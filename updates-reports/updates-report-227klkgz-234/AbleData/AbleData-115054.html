                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

Developed by Eduardo Miranda at the University of Plymouth Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research (ICCMR) in the United Kingdom, this BCI device allows individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, muscular disorders, and paralysis to participate in creating music. Miranda’s instrument allows individuals with paralysis to play music using only their thoughts. The device consists of a specially developed EEG system. Users are trained to focus on a repeated stimulus, pushing a button, for example, which allows the system and the user to associate particular brain signals with specific tasks. The device detects the unique pattern in the EEG associated with the particular stimulus, and can trigger a musical note or melody when the pattern is detected. The user can even change the intensity of the stimulus, like pushing the button harder, by varying the intensity of attention.  Thus far, Miranda and his team have only been able to successfully develop a four-button system, but it is certainly enough to create music and could prove to be therapeutic for patients with brain and spinal cord injuries.
