This OCR software scans documents and reads scanned or electronic text aloud using synthetic speech. Documents are shown on screen with words highlighted as they are spoken. This combined auditory and visual presentation of information helps increase reading accuracy, speed, and comprehension for struggling readers. This software can read documents in portable document file (.pdf), hypertext markup language (HTML), and DAISY digital talking book formats. It presents the original image, with color graphics, photographs, and columns intact, while reading the text aloud. Documents can also be opened, edited, and saved in Microsoft Word format. The program offers a suite of learning tools, including syllabification, pronounciation, text preview, thesaurus, phonetic spelling, and a dictionary. Users can choose from a variety of output voices, and can speed up or slow the pace and replay any word or phrase at will. The user may also select from continuous, self-paced, or word-by-word reading modes. The program also enables users to take notes, add them to the document, and read, print, and review them. As a test-taking program, this software allows teachers to accommodate students&#x27; Individualized Education Plan (IEP) needs for visual and auditory accommodations. The software reads questions and answers aloud, and allows students to type answers directly onto the image of a scanned test. Another feature of this software is the ability to automatically search for books by title or author on electronic text repositories such as Bookshare.org, Project Gutenberg, or the Baen Free Library, and then download and read those books. OPTIONS: Three versions of Kurzweill 3000 for Windows are available: a scan/read color version ($1,895), a scan/read black-and-white version ($1,095), and a read-only version called Read Station ($349). The Read Station program can be used by students who obtain scanned reading materials from their teachers and therefore do not need their own scanning software. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 300 megaherz (MHz) Pentium III or better processor Windows 95/98/ME/2000/NT/XP, 128 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM), 300 to 400 MB hard disk space, CD-ROM drive, 16-bit high color display support for color images, SVGA monitor with 800 by 600 resolution or higher, sound card and speakers, and a TWAIN-compliant scanner.
