This program teaches 80 signs and words which are related to medical and emergency situations. Categories include reasons for medical care (allergic reaction, broken bone); first aid (bandage, gauze); help (police, ambulance); medical clinic (doctor, nurse, prescription); operating room (surgeon, operating table); and patient&#x27;s room (hospital bed, call button). Multimedia software combines live action video and human-quality audio in an adult format. Corresponding print exercises to reinforce learning (approximately 100 hours of print individual and group activities). The program also offers an unmanaged review section for previously learned words, signs, and concepts, as well as a pre-assessment in both print and software formats. The software preassessment results electronically assign user activities based on skill level. A post-assessment documents skill acquisition. Additional features include closed captioning that may be turned on or off and options to adjust the program to the level of the learner. Two levels of audio are provided: one very basic and one more advanced. User results can be viewed and/or printed. Assignments can be modified and the software and print activities can be customized. A screen print function allows for any screen in the program to be printed. This program is touch screen compatible, switch accessible, and IntelliKeys accessible (see separate entry). Each program also comes with its own management system. This program manager handles set-up, administration, benchmarking, scoring, and reporting user results. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version requires a Pentium or compatible processor or better (200 MegaHertz recommended); Windows 95 / NT 4.0 or higher; CD-ROM drive (6X minimum); a minimum of 32 megabytes (MB) RAM (64 MB recommended); sound card and speakers (16-bit sound recommended);SVGA Graphics (640 x 480 minimum, 16-bit recommended); and a printer. The Macintosh version requires PowerPC or better; System 7.5.5 or better or OSX or better; CD-ROM drive (6X minimum); a minimum of 32 MB RAM (64 MB recommended); sound card and speakers (16-bit sound recommended); SVGA Graphics (640 x 480 minimum, 16-bit recommended); and a printer.
