It enables users with limited range of motion or no movement in their hands or arms to move the mouse cursor without having to reach for their mouse or drag a finger across a touchpad. When the user moves his or her eyes and directs his gaze to where he wants the cursor to go, the Tobii EyeX Software, combined with the sensors on the controller, will track the user’s eye movement and move the mouse cursor accordingly.
                                
                                The Tobii EyeX Controller provides access to a wide range of video games, and offers increased privacy and security. The device will automatically dim the screen whenever the user looks away, stay awake until the user steps away from the computer, and automatically sign the user in when he looks at the device. This last feature is made possible with Windows Hello, the biometric security feature for Windows 10. With Windows Hello, Tobii can power biometric facial recognition for Windows 10 and enable users to sign in to their computer, apps or services with just their presence in lieu of a password. Mount the Tobii EyeX Controller to the computer screen using the provided adhesive strip and connect it to a USB 3.0 port.<img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="End inserted content."/></ins>
