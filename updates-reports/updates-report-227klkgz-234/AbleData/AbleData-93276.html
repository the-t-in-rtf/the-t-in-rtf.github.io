The programs were selected and adapted so that synthesized voice output would provide all the information that the screen provides, so that they could be used by visually impaired students. The disks contain primarily educational programs. There are currently 78 &quot;volumes,&quot; each volume being a side of a disk (disks are filled on both sides). There is a disk of Morse code programs for amateur radio, a DOS utilities disk, six disks on math, fourteen disks on language arts, four on social studies, two with musical selections, one with a typing drill program, and seven with educational games. There are also disks with High School subject matter: seven on computer science, four on general science and physics, two on math, and seven on industrial arts. The rest of the disks are PRODOS programs related to word processing. A speech synthesizer is required to use the programs with voice output. Contact FDLRS/South for information on ordering. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple IIe and Apple IIGS computers.
