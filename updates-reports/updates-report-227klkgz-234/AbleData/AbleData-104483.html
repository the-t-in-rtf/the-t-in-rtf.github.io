This application (or app) for the Apple iPad enables students to develop reading and writing skills. Students can use the child-friendly keyboard to type into the word processor and various speech options allow them to review what they have written. The program is intended to help students become more independent writers by finding and correcting errors themselves. The word predictor suggests words fitting the context of students’ writing, allowing them to use varied vocabulary and helping them to create flowing, grammatically correct text with accurate spelling. Topic-specific &quot;Word Banks&quot; from the LearningGrids website are accessible from within the app. Users can also make their own Word Banks. Users can use the app&#x27;s &quot;Sound Shift&quot; feature to listen to a word in a Word Bank before selecting it. A talking spell checker and child-friendly Sassoon font are included. Work can be printed on any Airprint-compatible printer and shared via email or using the built-in Dropbox feature. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 6.0 or later.
