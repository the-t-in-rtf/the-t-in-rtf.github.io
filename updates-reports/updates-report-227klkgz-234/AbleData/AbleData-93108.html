These three software programs make up Attainment&#x27;s Dollar and Cents Software Series. The First Money program, Level I, teaches the value of money to beginners and to those who do not read. It teaches money names and the concepts of equal value and what something is worth. Voice prompts and graphic prompts lead students through each segment, with each segment offering display or multiple choice options. Spending Money, Level II, a more advanced program, simulates making purchases and using the correct combinations of bills and/or coins. Students also learn comparison shopping at the &quot;Money Mall&quot; using a shopping list and computer cash. Making Change, Level III in the series, is the most advanced where users function like any store clerk by entering purchases and returning change. The program randomly generates hundreds of purchasing situations and makes an excellent vocational training and applied math program. Its features include animated graphics, quality audio and a Canadian currency option. Programs can be purchased as a package or separately on 3.5 inch diskette or CD-ROM. For students with physical disabilities, these programs are TouchWindow (see separate entry) accessible. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh or IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Macintosh: A 68020 or higher microprocessor, 1 megabyte (MB) RAM, hard drive,  Apple superdrive or high density 1.4 MB floppy disk drive, System 7 (version 7.0 or higher), 12-inch or larger color monitor, and a mouse or TouchWindow (see separate entry). For IBM and compatible computers Windows95  and a sound card are required. WARRANTY: The manufacturer guarantees complete satisfaction with this product or it may be returned for exchange, refund, or replacement within 30 days of the date of purchase.
