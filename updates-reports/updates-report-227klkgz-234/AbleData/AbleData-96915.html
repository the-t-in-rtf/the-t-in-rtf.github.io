                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Keyboarding by Ability is a typing instruction program designed to teach keyboarding skills at employable speeds using a touch system to people who have use of only one hand or who have use of 3 or less fingers on one hand. This program utilizes a unique progressive learning system (which includes visual cues and human voice), allowing the student to learn by building upon his or her progress. Each lesson is presented in an easy step-by-step format. The first lesson shows a full visually-cued keyboard with only the learned keys displayed. As the lessons progress, new keys are displayed, thereby allowing the student to focus only on the learned keys. This program includes a graded spelling practice and quiz, and 1-, 3-, and 5-minute speed tests that automatically time and grade the user, and a complete set of lesson plans and instructional goals that enable a teacher to fulfill and adhere to the mandates of a student&#x27;s Individualized Education Plan (I.E.P.). Upon successful completion of each lesson, supplemental graded Data Input Exercises are supplied for reinforcement of acquired keyboarding skills. A printed record of all exercises including name, date, and grade, will provide the teacher and parents with an accurate and progressive record of the student&#x27;s achievement. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM or compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Microsoft Windows NT, 98, 2000, ME, XP or Vista; 512 megabytes (MB) memory; 54 MB of hard drive space; CD-ROM drive; sound card.
