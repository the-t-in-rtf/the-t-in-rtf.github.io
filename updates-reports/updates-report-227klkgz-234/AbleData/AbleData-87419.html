The wrist supports have a wide surface area, are countoured and fully padded, and are designed to fit most standard keyboards. The padding in the support is durable polyurethane foam and the fabric is polyester. It does not promote friction and allows the users skin to breathe. The Standard Wrist Support, models WS100 and WS125, has a plastic keyboard baseplate that is durable and lightweight and fits completely under the keyboard. There are rubber feet designed to prevent it from sliding out of place. The Portable Wrist Support, models BL100 and BL125, do not have a baseplate but do have non skid material on the bottom surface to keep it in place. DIMENSIONS: Both types are available in heights of 1 inch or 1.25 inches. WARRANTY: One year limited warranty.
