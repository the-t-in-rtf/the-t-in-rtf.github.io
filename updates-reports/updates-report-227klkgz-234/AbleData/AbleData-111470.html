This program teaches 45 pairs of things that go together in five computerized stories with animation and sound effects. Stories star a character called Buddy Bear. The program uses common everyday objects to teach association skills. Users are asked questions about the associations, with three response choices included for each question. Associations are based on one of five themes: helping at home, having fun, animals, getting ready for school, and picnic. Correct responses are reinforce immediately with amusing animations, sound effects, and a friendly “Good job!” Incorrect responses get a reassuring “Oops. Try again” message. The animation and sound effects bring context to each association-teaching screen. The program is designed to mprove receptive and expressive language, attention span, listening skills, and eye-hand coordination. A Quit button allows the program to be ended at any time. The program comes on a CD-ROM, and can be operated directly from the CD-ROM or copied onto a hard drive. Instructions and a jewel case are included. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh or IBM and compatible personal computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Mac computers, OS 10 or later operating system and a Macintosh G3 or above processor. IBM and compatible computers require Windows 98SE, 2000, or XP operating system and a Pentium II and higher processor. For either type of computer, requirements include an 8x or faster CD-ROM drive; soundcard; and a video card that supports an 800 x 600 display.
