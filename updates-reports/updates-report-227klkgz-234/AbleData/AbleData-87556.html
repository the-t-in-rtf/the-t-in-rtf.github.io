                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>SoundSmart is a cognitive skills tutorial program and auditory training activity designed to improve listening skills, following directions, phonemic awareness, working memory, mental processing speed, and impulse control. It is a set of 11 entertaining, multi-level talking Bingo games organized in three modules. (1) Attention Coach - (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). In this module, spoken instructions become increasingly complex as the player progresses through a series of alphabet games. The player must remember what to do even when the instructor gives multi-step instructions, then changes her mind. (2) Math &amp;amp; Memory Coach - (Levels A, 1, 2, 3, and 4). In this module, working memory is improved as the player learns to do math in his or her head. When set up for a child, each of these five programs addresses the corresponding grade level of the elementary school math curriculum, grades K through 4. Adult users are presented with more challenging problems. (3) Sound Discrimination Coach - (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). In this module, challenging phonemic awareness drills train the player to listen well under all types of conditions. The player must wait to answer until the stoplight turns green. Sometimes it delays on the yellow light, then changes its mind altogether about the question. The pictures slowly revealing themselves provide additional stimulation through closure (the brain having to fill in the missing pieces). Within each module, behavioral training tracks can be used to customize the programs for individual needs. Tracks include a Speed Track to challenge alertness and improve mental processing speed; a Patience Track to improve impulse control; a Listening Track to improve auditory attention, figure-ground discrimination, and auditory focus; and a Challenge Track combining all of these tracks. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium III 700 or higher PC processor; DirectX 8 or higher; 20 GB hard drive with at least 1 GB free space; 256 MB of RAM; Windows 2000 / XP / Vista operating system; DirectX compatible video card with at least 16 MB of video RAM; DVD Rom drive; mouse, trackball or touchscreen; DirectX compatible soundcard; headphones or external speakers.
