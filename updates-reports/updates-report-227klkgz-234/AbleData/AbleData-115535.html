This application (or app) enables an Apple iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. Images can be uploaded into the program from the user’s home computer or through an online image search, then cropped/resized and active “sound areas” can be added. The number and size of the “sound areas” can be customized and spoken messages can be added to the “sound areas” by using the Text-To-Speech feature with one of five preloaded voices. The user also can record their own voice to the “sound areas.” When multiple visual scenes are created with active sound areas, related scenes can be added into “books.” Books can be created and images grouped into the book by theme or area of interest. Multiple books can be created within the apps book library and as many visual scenes as needed added into the “book.” Scenes include kitchen, bedroom, child’s bedroom, living room, bathroom, park or doctor’s office. For example, a book titled “My Home” can include images of different rooms in the home and sound areas can be added to the images to label different objects or people. A bedroom scene may say “go to bed” when the bed is touched or “read a book” when a bookcase is touched. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
