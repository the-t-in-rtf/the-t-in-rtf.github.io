Read &amp;amp; Write is a voice output word processor designed for use by individuals with dyslexia and other learning disabilities. This toolbar-style application package offers speech feedback as the typing progresses in a choice of letter by letter, word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, or by highlighted text block. Word by word speaking of highlighted text helps the user associate the written word with its sound. This software will read any onscreen text, including menu icons, Internet web pages, e-mail, and spreadsheets. Standard features include a voice-output spell checker with spelled-alike and sound-alike suggestions, a voice-output thesaurus linked to the spell checker, word prediction, abbreviation expansion, automatic correction, and homophone discrimination. Second language capabilities are available when working in Spanish. The software also offers screen magnification of text, tool bars, and help files and text and background colors can be changed to meet the user&#x27;s needs. Specialized dictionaries for primary school, medicine, and geology are available. Speech fonts include U.S. male and female, United Kingdom male and female, Spanish male, French male, and others. An optional choice of four animated characters to provide speech feedback is also included. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 350 Processor; Windows 98, 2000, XP, ME, or NT4; Internet Explorer 6 or later (available on the Installation CD); sound card and speakers; CD ROM drive; 128 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM) (250 MB recommended); 400 MB Free Disk Space.
