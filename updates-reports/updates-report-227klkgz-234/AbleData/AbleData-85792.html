The program is designed to enhance functional language skills, increase understanding of objects and their functions or descriptions, and build independence as students identify objects by name and function using familiar locations in a town. The program has four basic activities in six different settings. The activities include: discovering names (select an item within the scene on-screen and the program gives a description or function of it), identifying names (the program asks the user to find various items according to their names), discovering functions/descriptions (select an item and the program gives the function or description of it), and identifying descriptions/functions (the program asks the user to find certain items according their description or function). Each of these activities can be explored within the context of graphics depicting a doctor&#x27;s office, dentist&#x27;s office, restaurant, park, city neighborhood, and suburban neighborhood. More than 100 objects can be located in the six settings. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB) RAM; a Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD drive. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB Application RAM; and a 4x speed CD-ROM.
