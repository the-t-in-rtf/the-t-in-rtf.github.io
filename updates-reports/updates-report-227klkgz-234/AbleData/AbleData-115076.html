It is designed to provide wireless voice control of a person&#x27;s computer as well as environmental, communications and entertainment systems that are connected to the computer. After installing the Speak4Use (S4U) software on a computer, the user adds the S4U Environment Controller (included) which provides the voice interface and the S4U Appliance Modules, two of which are included to operate lights and appliances. The system can also be used to notify a person in another room of an emergency. The user speaks commands into a wireless radio frequency (RF) microphone (included) that has a maximum range of 100 feet. Speak4Use can also be used to operate other computer software applications, and the user can set up appointments and reminders using the system. A quick start guide and tutorial and live setup telephone support are included with purchase. OPTIONS: Additional S4U Appliance Modules are available to control entertainment and communications systems; wireless speakers can be added in separate rooms to allow the user to hear audible system responses to commands. POWER: The RF microphone has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS: Microsoft Windows 7 with at least 2 gigabytes (GB) of memory (RAM). POWER: The RF microphone has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge; a USB charger is included.
