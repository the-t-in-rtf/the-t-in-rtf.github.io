This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use an Apple iPad to help children learn how to have multi-exchange conversations with their peers in a variety of social settings. The auditory pattern of conversation is presented in a visual format to help children recognize and master the flow of conversation. Children will learn when it is appropriate to introduce themselves, ask questions, make observations and change the subject of the conversation. Children can initiate or respond to conversations and record their half of the conversation. Conversations can be four or eight exchanges long, and up to 160 distinct conversations are available. Conversations can also be archived and emailed, and the app comes with two group and two one-on-one conversation settings. A child’s name, age, primary interest and city of residence can be personalized to be used in conversations and a child’s recordings are interlaced with pre-recorded audio to create complete conversations. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
