The Access Overlays allow IntelliKeys (see separate entry) or a switch to be used to access the programs instead of a mouse. Simply slide the appropriate overlay into IntelliKeys or plug in a switch or switches, and start the program. The overlay and switch setups are sent automatically and work with every screen of each program. With the Cause and Effect overlay, every time the user presses the Surprise Key, a random Hot Spot is selected. The Directional Scan overlay allows the user to press a key or switch to move forward through Hot Spots, another to move back and a third to select. Finally, the Automatic Scan overlay is one large key which, when pressed, starts scanning Hot Spots. When the same spot is pressed again, the selection is made. Each set contains the 3 access overlays, a Macintosh installation disk, a Windows installation disk, and a Macintosh/Windows User&#x27;s Guide. Five sets are available. Set A provides access to three Living Books (sold separately):Arthur&#x27;s Teacher Trouble, Arthur&#x27;s Birthday Party, and Arthur&#x27;s Reading Race. Set B includes overlays for the following Living Books (Sold separately, see separate entries): Dr. Seuss&#x27;s ABC, Green Eggs and Ham, and The Cat in the Hat. Set C includes overlays for the following Living Books (sold separately): Just Grandma and Me, The New Kid on the Block, and the Tortoise and the Hare. Set D includes overlay for The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight, The Berenstain Bears in the Dark, Sheila Rae the Brave, and Stellaluna (Living Books sold separately). Set E includes overlays for Harry and the Haunted House, Little Monster at School, and Ruff&#x27;s Bone (Living Books sold Separately). COMPATIBILITY:  For use on Macintosh or IBM and compatible computers with Windows. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  See system requirements for corresponding Living Books.
