By combining games, music and animated characters, children have fun as they develop problem solving, strategic thinking and computation skills. Each activity has multiple levels of difficulty designed to build both confidence and motivation. There are seven activities including Bowling for Numbers, Puzzle Patterns, Sticklers and Rhythm Generator. In addition to basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, students practice estimation and equivalencies; pattern recognition and spatial relationships; line and shape recognition; scale and symmetry; and creation and manipulation of fractions in relation to music. This program can be used with the TouchWindow (see separate entry) to make them touch-active for students with physical disabilities. COMPATIBILITY: Macintosh and IBM. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Macintosh System 7.0.1 or higher; 4 MB RAM; 256 color or gray scale monitor; CD-ROM drive. Optional: TouchWindow. Windows system: 33 MHz 386DX or compatibles; 4 MB RAM; SVGA monitor; hard disk; MPC compatible CD-ROM drive and sound card; Windows 3.1 or higher;3.5 inch disk drive; DOS 5.0 or higher; mouse.
