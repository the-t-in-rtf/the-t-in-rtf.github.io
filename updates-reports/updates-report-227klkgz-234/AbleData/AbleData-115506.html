This application (or app) allows a parent or teacher to use their Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to teach a child or student to talk about things rather than just labeling them. The app contains about 120 images. The child or student is asked in many mixed and varied phrases to identify 40 different features, functions or classes of items, objects and people. For example, an image displaying a hot air balloon, a paper airplane and an astronaut is shown on the scree and the app speaks &quot;Touch the one that goes to space.&quot; The correct answer is an astronaut. Sound can be turned off, and the app can be used by both visual and auditory learners. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 2.2.1 or later.
