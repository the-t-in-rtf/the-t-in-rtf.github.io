It can be used with any game application (or app) that has an on-screen joystick. The Fling should be placed over the game&#x27;s onscreen joystick. This joystick provides auto-centering and force feedback. It gives the user the feel of an analog joystick, so the iPad games feel even more immersive. Compatible games include Super Mega Worm, Meteor Blitz, Otto Matic, Aralon: Sword and Shadow, and RoboKill. The Fling is made from smooth anodized aluminum and transparent engineering-grade resin that is tough and flexible. The joystick stays in place on a screen by means of two suction cups, which provides a secure but removable grip. The joystick has a mechanical spring that is tuned to provide the proper amount of resistance for precision control. To navigate through the game, the user presses the thumb on the thumbstick. When the iPad screen illuminates, it shines through the transparent joystick, so the user can see the screen and game action. A microfiber case is included.
