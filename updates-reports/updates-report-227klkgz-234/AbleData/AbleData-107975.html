In this program, Tiger has lost his voice and needs help looking for it. Children &quot;talk&quot; for Tiger and their voices are recorded to create a movie. During Tiger&#x27;s search, animated characters appear and ask children questions to elicit their thoughts, suggestions, and opinions. Conversations are developed using the child&#x27;s voice along with other pre-recorded voices. If a child is asked a question and does not record an answer, there is the option to click on one of the characters and the scene will continue. This allows a child who initially refuses to speak to interact with the program and gradually increase the number of replies he or she records for Tiger. In the final scene of Tiger&#x27;s Tale, students click on various objects to find Tiger&#x27;s voice. Afterwards, they can watch the movie and hear their own voices speaking for Tiger. These &quot;home&quot; movies can be saved for future viewing, and enable students to measure their progress over time. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz) or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB) RAM; Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD-ROM drive. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB Application RAM; and a 4x speed CD-ROM.  Both versions also require a microphone (not included).
