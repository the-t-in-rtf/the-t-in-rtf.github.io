This program has children building sand castles while building spelling skills. The program is not age- or grade-related, but focuses on development and builds skills sequentially, progressing from simple three-letter words through harder multi-syllabic words. Children enjoy windsurfing, diving and other spelling games as they encounter more than 3,000 words through seven different activity sets. Features include full speech capability, plus options to use pre-selected work lists or customized lists. Work may focus on commonly misspelled words, compound words, or sentence usage drills. Teachers can individualize the program for each child. Correct answers are rewarded by a funny cartoon sequences. The assessment module contains one placement and three diagnostic tests, which establish the user&#x27;s skill level and pinpoint areas of weakness. Results are compiled and stored for each user and can be printed for later review. A third disc offers 100 printable worksheets to reinforce skills away from the computer. Each worksheet is also linked to onscreen activities. COMPATIBILITY: The CD-ROM offers versions for use on IBM and compatible computers and Macintosh computers with or without a network. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version (including Power and iMacs) requires, Windows 3.1 or higher, 8 megabytes (MB) RAM, 2X speed or faster CD-ROM drive, sound card, and SVGA monitor. The program is compatible with Windows XP home and professional editions. The Macintosh version requires an LC 3 or better processor, 8 MB RAM, and a 2X speed or faster CD-ROM drive.
