Young readers and pre-readers discover answers to questions about the seasons and weather as they interact with the colorful, animated pages of the program. The program offers full speech support and fully supported with narrated instructions and talking stories. Fun, simple games and activities allow children to explore how weather relates to people, their surroundings, their feelings, and the foods they eat. Topic-related word banks aid children in writing about their new knowledge and pictograms to record the weather by the week or by the month. COMPATIBILITY: The CD-ROM includes versions for use on IBM and compatible or Macintosh computers with or without a network. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version required a P-75 processor, Windows 95, 16 megabytes (MB) RAM, a 4X CD-ROM drive, sound card, and SVGA graphics. The Macintosh version requires Power PC, Operating System 7, 8 MB RAM, 4X CD-ROM drive, and a color monitor with thousands of colors.
