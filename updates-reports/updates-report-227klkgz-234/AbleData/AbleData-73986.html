The game presents a virtual world set in the Old West and created purely from sound imagery. The player invents a character, which develops in an interactive evolving story line as the player meets and interacts with many crazy characters while exploring the town of Grizzly Gulch. The player can settle into the saloon to play a game of chance, fight outlaws in blazing arcade-style gun battles, or earn a living in the hotel by whacking rats. Game features include a four key control interface, stereo sound, original music, over 1,000 digitally recorded sound effects and dialog lines, a choice of two difficulty levels, and complete audio help that can be accessed at any time. There is a town bank where the player can deposit and withdraw money, or take out a loan if necessary. Money can also be won at four different casino games in the saloon, including blackjack (Double Down, Split, and Insurance), poker, a slot machine, and a shell game. Items can be purchased in the General Store. Players receive bounty mission assignments in the Marshall&#x27;s office, track the outlaws to their hideouts, fight it out to bring them in, and lock the captured outlaws in jail. Players can practice shooting skills by picking off flying bottles at the target range, then put their gunfighting ability to the test foiling bank robberies, fighting off ambushes, and bringing the outlaws and their gangs to justice in blazing gun battles. There are also plot twists such as surprise rattlesnake attacks while traveling through the desert. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 60 processor; Windows 95/98/2000/NT/XP operating system; 16 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM); CD-ROM drive; 190 MB hard drive space; DirectX 6.1 or above (included); DirectX compatible stereo sound card; speakers (headphones recommended).
