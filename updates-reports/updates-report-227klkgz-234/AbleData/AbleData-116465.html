This application (or app) is an interactive game that includes over 50 familiar items around the house with original artwork and entertaining sound effects. A letter name is spoken when it is touched and it snaps into place when it is pushed to the right location. Children will hear the word spelled out when they complete a word. Children can play the game by themselves or with others by talking about the pictures, saying the names of the letters, and watching the pictures spin around and sound off. Children can use phonics (speech sounds) or letter names, and select serif or sans serif font when playing the game. The auto-advance feature can be disabled so children can see the picture and completed word before advancing to the next word. The user interface has been tested with toddlers and young children and is designed specifically for little fingers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
