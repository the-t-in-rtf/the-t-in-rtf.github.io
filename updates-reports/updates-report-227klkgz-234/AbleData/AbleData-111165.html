The RollerMouse Classic features a cylindrical rollerbar, three buttons and a scroll wheel to perform all of the functions of a standard mouse. The rubber-coated steel rollerbar rotates to move the mouse pointer vertically, and it slides horizontally to move the mouse pointer in the same direction. The rollerbar can be clicked, and the click force for the rollerbar is adjustable. The three buttons can be configured to perform functions such as single click and double click. The RollerMouse Classic includes a keyboard tray with a soft, lycra-covered wrist rest at the base that can be removed for cleaning. The wrist rest is divided into two sections by the rollerbar, buttons and scroll wheel, which are located just to the left of center. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM personal computers (PC) or compatible computers and Apple Macintosh computers (USB device with PS2 adapter included). SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: No drivers are required to operate the mouse; some operating systems require a driver for the scroll wheel. OPTIONS: Extended RollerWave wrist rest. DIMENSIONS (HxLxW): 1.25 x 20.875 x 11.75 inches. The rollerbar is 6.3125 inches long. COLOR: Black and white. WARRANTY: 2-year warranty.
