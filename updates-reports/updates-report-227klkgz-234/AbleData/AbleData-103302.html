While distinguishing tremors from intentional movements, this movement tracking system enables the user to control the mouse and type letters with movements ranging from very small to very large. The unit mounts on the back of the user&#x27;s computer display and plugs into the computer with a USB cord. A small tripod is included, and a plastic pocket for easily mounting AccuPoint to a laptop is also included. A small plastic reflector that works with the unit is attached to the user&#x27;s forehead or another body part using double sided tape. A software suite is included for installation on the computer. To select items on the computer screen, the user points to the desired spot and holds his or her head still (a process called &quot;dwell&quot;). The user can set the dwell time, and dwell can be turned on and off to prevent inadvertent clicking. If the user prefers switch input to dwelling, there are two programmable switch ports on the back panel of AccuPoint for inputting left and right mouse clicks via the user’s favorite switch. OPTIONS: Complete AccuPoint System with tablet kiosk slate computer (PC i440T) with touch screen and one year warranty, Windows 7 operating system, quick release VESA mount with port replicator, Ergotron LX desk mount, AccuPoint Absolute Tracking System with one year warranty, AccuPoint software suite with word prediction, OpenOffice Software Suite, and folding USB keyboard.
