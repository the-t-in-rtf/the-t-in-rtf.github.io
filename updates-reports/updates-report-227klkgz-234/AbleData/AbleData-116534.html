This application (or app) allows a therapist or parent to use an Apple iPad to help children to practice listening, auditory memory and auditory processing as well as following directions and learning colors, comparatives and spatial concepts. This Lite version includes two concepts: behind and put in. Ten additional concepts are available in the full version of More Fun With Directions HD (see separate entry). This app will teach a child to receive and follow simple directions, such as &quot;Put the house in the puzzle,&quot; and more complex directions, such as &quot;Put something with windows, doors and a roof in the puzzle.&quot; Other features include settings to turn the text output on or off (to practice reading versus listening), selecting specific concepts, and selecting desired level of play (easy, intermediate, or advanced). The user also can turn on the &quot;Superstar Direction&quot; option, which causes surprise questions (&quot;What did you have to do?&quot;) to pop up at random times for additional practice remembering and expressive language. The child&#x27;s response to each question is recorded and can be played back. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
