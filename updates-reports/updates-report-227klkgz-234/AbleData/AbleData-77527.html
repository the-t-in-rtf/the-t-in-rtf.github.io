                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Matrix Touch Keyboards are optical keyboards designed for use by individuals with arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), carpal tunnel syndrome, and other upper extremity disabilities which limit or prevent pressure on the fingers. These keyboards utilize a matrix of infrared sensors to detect the presence of the finger on the membrane overlay, eliminating the need for pressure. These compact keyboards can be placed in the user&#x27;s lap, on the bed, on a desk, or on a bedside stand, enabling them to be used where they are most convenient and, when fitted with an optional touch pad, they provide complete control of the computer. The keyboards can also be used in conjunction with voice input software (not included). The keyboards include customized overlays, enabling the keyboard to be customized for the user&#x27;s specific needs and abilities. The overlays come in a choice of colors, can be personalized with the user&#x27;s name, and can provide only the keys desired. In addition, the overlays can include text for function names and hot keys (for example, a key can be programmed to input a web address or to perform a two-key function such as ALT+E). Keyboards can also be created in any language.  Because their are no spaces around the keys, the unit can be wiped off in case of spills. DIMENSIONS: Model 83 PKB-SAM is 8 x 13.25 inches, model 83 PKB-SA is 6.25 x 12 inches, and model 83 PKB-SAM-CKPS2R is 8 x 16.75 inches.
