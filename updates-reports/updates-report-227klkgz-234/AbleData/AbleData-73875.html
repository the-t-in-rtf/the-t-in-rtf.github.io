                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Earobics is an auditory perceptual training and pre-reading tutorial program designed for use by children and adults with communication or learning disabilities or who are hard of hearing. It provides phonological awareness and auditory processing training for the prevention and remediation of reading and other language-based disabilities. The software comes in home, classroom, and professional versions. The professional version is designed for use by reading specialists, audiologists, and speech language pathologists (SLP&#x27;s). The classroom version, also called Earobics Literacy Launch, is available in CD-ROM, Local Area Network (LAN), or Wide Area Network (WAN) format. The Home, Professional, and Classroom versions each include three products: Step 1 and Step 2 for children, and Step 1 for adolescents and adults. Step 1 features six interactive games with up to 114 levels of play, teaching the phonological awareness, auditory processing and introductory phonics skills required for learning to read and spell. The games also develop general cognitive skills that support learning, such as attention and memory. Step 2 features five interactive games with up to 168 levels of play, addressing the skills targeted in Step 1 at a higher level, plus language processing skills that are critical for extracting meaning from spoken language and written text. Step 1 for Adolescents and Adults provides game-style multimedia instruction designed to appeal to adolescents and adults who are struggling to read faster, spell better, and improve their comprehension. Game play is automatically adjusted to the skill level and progress of the student. Other factors that can be adjusted include the amount of visual cueing and auditory feedback, the rate at which sounds are presented, the length of sound units, and the amount of background noise competing for the student&#x27;s attention. The Classroom and Professional versions include management tools to allow the teacher, audiologist, or SLP to customize each game to the needs of each student, by limiting play to the games that target the student&#x27;s deficit skills, choosing the starting levels of difficulty within each game, determining when skill training should be repeated or skipped, and customizing auditory repetition and other features. The software also automatically generates goals for each activity in IEP (Individualized Education Plan) format, collects performance data for each student, and prints each student&#x27;s progress reports by date or range of dates. A password option protects the confidentiality and reliability of data records. Names can be removed and added to the player list in the professional and classroom versions, but not the home version. OPTIONS: Professional Version options include Specialist/Clinician Resource Guides for Step 1, Step 2, and Step 1 for Adolescents and Adults. Classroom Version options include a Teacher&#x27;s Resource Guide; Integrated Multimedia Tools and Books, including uppercase and lowercase letter mats and letter sets, picture/word cards, letter/sound review deck, big and small books, videotapes, audiotapes, talking CD-ROM books; and School-to-Home Connections materials, including Earobics Home Software, take-home books, and reproducible activities and manipulatives. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple Macintosh or IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For IBM-compatible computers, 133 megaherta (Mhz) Pentium processor or above; Windows 95/98/NT operating system; 32 megabytes (MB) random access memory (RAM); 16 MB available RAM (32 MB recommended); 256 color display (16 bit color recommended); 4x CD-ROM drive; 10 MB available hard disk space; Soundblaster compatible 16-bit sound card and speakers. For Macintosh, Macintosh 603e Power Macintosh (604 Power Macintosh or above recommended); System 7.6.1 or higher operating system; 32 MB RAM; 16 MB available RAM (32 MB recommended); 256 color display (thousands of colors recommended); 4x CD-ROM drive; 10 MB available hard disk space.
