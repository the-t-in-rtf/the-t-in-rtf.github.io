This application, or &quot;app,&quot; boosts the user&#x27;s academic and cognitive performance by supporting the user in the executive function areas of memory, concentration, and organization. It helps students to step logically through complex thought and scheduling processes, allowing them to manage changing priorities. The &quot;What’s Up?&quot; feature enables users to organize their schedules throughout the day based on priority. When students feel challenged by their schedules, they can transmit their current &quot;What’s Up?&quot; schedule wirelessly at the touch of a button to one or more of their pre-selected mentors for guidance and encouragement. Mentors can include a peer mentor (an older student experienced in ADHD issues), parents, tutors, best friends, sports or life coaches, therapists, or others who have an interest in the success of the student. The &quot;What’s Done?&quot; feature displays tasks completed by the student in a given time period in a bright green color and can be transmitted wirelessly to one or more of the student’s pre-selected mentors. Transmitting this information (normally once a day) permits the student’s mentors to observe and acknowledge the progress made by the student and to offer encouragement. Together, &quot;What’s Up?&quot; and &quot;What’s Done?&quot; help students with ADHD deal with forgetfulness and procrastination. The app is intende to generate attention and acknowledgment from mentors that can motivate students to do the work needed, earn praise, and feel successful. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENT: iOS 3.2 or later operating system.
