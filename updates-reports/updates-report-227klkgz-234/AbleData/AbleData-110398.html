This device is intended for those who are new to using a computer or who need a simpler alternative to more comprehensive programs. This screen reader works almost entirely using the standard keyboard arrow keys. Features include echoing of each keystroke and word; selective reading of the screen by character, word, line, or entire page; selective reading of menus; and, reading of dialog boxes and buttons. This screen reader works with Microsoft Word, WordPad, Notepad, Desktop, Explorer, My Computer, Outlook and Outlook Express, and Excel. It also includes a Web browser that breaks up complex Web pages into sequential links and lines of text that can be navigated with the arrow keys. The system also includes two high-quality SAPI-5 compliant voices: NeoSpeech Kate and Paul. (These voices require installation via the accompanying CD. Otherwise, Thunder-RJ uses the SAPI voice already on the computer, such as SAPI SAM.) Thunder-RJ is available in a choice of configurations: The first configuration provides the screenreader on an MP3 player/USB thumb drive stick, which enables the screenreader stick to be a stand-alone MP3 player, enabling the user to save MP3 music files, e-books, or podcasts on the USB drive feature of the stick, and listen to them through the included ear buds or other headphones. For screenreading, audio comes from the regular PC speakers. The USB stick is available with a choice of 512 megabytes (MB) or one gigabyte (GB) of storage capacity. The second option is designed for use with computers without an accessible headphone jack if headphone use is desired for screenreading. The screenreader is packaged on a USB sound card stick that is also a USB 256 MB thumb drive stick. This small USB device routes all sound from the PC to a headphone jack on the device; however, it does not act as an MP3 player. The system can also be purchased as software only for one computer or for one owner with multiple computers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with computers using Windows 2000/XP/Vista. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: CD Drive for installing voices. OPTIONS: MP3 Player/USB drive stick for second configuration.
