                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>The Half-Qwerty One-Handed and Two-Handed Keyboard is a one-handed keyboard designed for use by individuals with use of only one hand, hemiplegia, carpal tunnel syndrome on one side, and other disabilities of the hand. This keyboard can also be used in conjunction with a braille dispaly by people with blindness or low vision. This full keyboard has a standard QWERTY layout that allows one-handed typing with either hand as well as standard two-handed typing. For one-handed typing, the user places the hand where it would normally be placed for touch-typing on that half of the keyboard. To type the letters of the other half of the keyboard, the user holds down the space bar and does the same finger movements that would normally be done by the other hand. Tapping the space bar alone still types a space. The keyboard also has a Sticky Keys feature that allows the user to type modifier keys (for example, Shift, Control, Alt) and the key being modified in succession, rather than simultaneously. Depressing and releasing a modifier key once makes it active for the next key typed. Pressing the modifier key twice locks it until it is unlocked by pressing the it again. The keyboard uses Alps mechanical key switches, which provide tactile feedback. It can be remapped to a layout that is standard in the user&#x27;s country, by choosing the desired layout from the computer&#x27;s control panel. The extra key in the lower left corner of non-U.S. keyboards (next to the Shift key) is represented by typing double-Shift-Z. COMPATIBILITY: This keyboard is equipped with USB, PS/2, and ADB interfaces and a built-in two-port USB hub for use with IBM and compatible or Macintosh computers. WARRANTY: Ten years.
