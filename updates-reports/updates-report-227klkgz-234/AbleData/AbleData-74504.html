                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>TestTalker is a voice output test program designed for use by students who are blind or have low vision, or by their teachers. This software program can help students with test taking, worksheet completion, and with study materials. It can also help people complete forms electronically. It provides a computerized version of a test, worksheet, or other form that can talk. Tests are presented bimodally, with words highlighted on screen as they are spoken aloud. As an accommodation tool, this program maintains the integrity of the written test by presenting it without modification. The program has two modules: the Teacher Edition, a test-creating module designed for teachers; and the Student Edition, a test-taking module, which comes in a pack of five. The Teacher Edition scans pre-printed tests and allows teachers to configure them so students can complete the tests electronically. The Student Edition reads the test aloud and allows students to answer the questions. Teachers and students can print the blank or completed tests. This program supports true/false, multiple choice, fill-in, and extended answer tests. Tests in PDF (Adobe Portable Document Format) or Microsoft Word format can be opened in this software, but tests in ScanTron format are not supported. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium or higher processor running at least 450 megaHertz (MHz); Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP; 92 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM); a CD-ROM drive; and a compatible sound card with speaker. The Teacher Edition requires a supported TWAIN-compatible scanner, a video card, and a monitor capable of VGA video in 800x600, high-color 16-bit color mode or greater.
