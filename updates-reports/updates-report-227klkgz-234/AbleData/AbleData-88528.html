This program will challenge students to develop logical reasoning, analyze and synthesize information, explore elementary computer programming concepts, experiment with physics properties and build key problem solving skills. It allows students to learn how to observe, investigate, and solve problems more efficiently and effectively, providing them with tools they need in everyday life. There are five challenging activities with &quot;real&quot; world settings in which to solve problems. In &quot;Stocktopus,&quot; students make trades with stock brokers all over the world. In &quot;Half Time,&quot; students begin learning computer programming skills as software engineers. &quot;Fripple Place&quot; allows students to become detectives to solve the Case of the Empty Fripple House. &quot;Carving BLOX&quot; and &quot;Photo Twister&quot; lets students strengthen creativity and visual thinking as they experiment with photographic images and basic physics properties. Thinkin Things 3 includes &quot;Grow Slides&quot; that control the difficulty level and automatically increases the level as students succeed in each activity. It also has built in scanning options for single switch input and has been designed to take full advantage of input using the TouchWindow (see separate entry). COMPATIBILITY: Available on dual platform CD-ROM for Macintosh and Windows. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows: windows 3.1 (enhanced mode), Windows 95 or later; 486/33 MHz required; hard disk with 2 MB free; CD-ROM drive (double speed recommended); 8 MB RAM required; SGVA, 640x480 (256 colors); Windows-compatible sound-output device; mouse. MAcintosh: Color Macintosh (256 colors required); System 7.0.1 or higher; 4 MB RAM (8 MB recommended); CD-ROM drive (double speed recommended); 13 inch monitor or larger; mouse.
