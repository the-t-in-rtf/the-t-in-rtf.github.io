This interactive program is designed to provide training in learning the basics to improving comprehension and increasing signing speed. This graphics-based program provides life-like photographs and moving animation of hands. LEARN SIGN WINDOW: This teaches the beginning signer how letter and number signs are formed and enables the user to type any word or number and then watch how it is fingerspelled. This window will also play the alphabet from A to Z and the numbers from 1 to 100. RECEPTIVE SIGN WINDOW: This application shows the graphic fingerspelling of a word and asks the user to choose the correct English word. It fingerspells words in random order from a vocabulary list that can be changed or enlarged by the user. The program keeps track of and informs the user how many words have been fingerspelled correctly, the number of words remaining in the current vocabulary, and current times for playback speed settings. EXPRESSIVE SIGN WINDOW: This displays an English word from a vocabulary list, and the user fingerspells along with the hand in the Signing Window. The program also allows the user to mark missed words and to repeat them later in the practice session. VOCABULARY WINDOW: This creates a new vocabulary file using user-selected words, allows the user to use letters, numbers, or sentences to make a variety of practice sessions, and saves vocabulary files for future use. SETTINGS WINDOW: Settings can be selected by the user to control fingerspelling speed, including length of time for the first and last letters, and overall speed. It provides controls for replaying missed words either immediately, at the end of the practice session, or both. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh computers or on IBM and compatible computers equipped with Windows. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Windows version requires a 386SX microprocessor higher, Windows 3.1 or higher, a minimum of two megabytes (MB) of RAM, and a 3.5-inch high density disk drive. The Macintosh version requires a 25 megaHertz (mHz) 68030 processor or better, System 7.0 or higher, a minimum of 4 MB RAM, and a color monitor.
