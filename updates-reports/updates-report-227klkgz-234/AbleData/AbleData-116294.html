The combo includes over 10,500 Literacy Support Pictures in both programs, allowing the flexibility to customize materials and vocabulary designed to support all curricula and subjects in English and Spanish, and the user can import additional photographs, clipart and personal artwork. The Picture It program (see separate entry) quickly adds picture symbols to text by automatically locating symbols that match typed text. It includes the LSP Thesaurus to enhance the software&#x27;s ability to match the appropriate picture or symbol to a word. The program aids the user in gaining literacy and language skills and increases receptive and expressive vocabularies. Available languages are English and Spanish. Intended for beginning readers and writers, the PixWriter program combines words, pictures, and speech. By selecting buttons, which hold words and graphics, users can write whole words, sentences, and stories. PixWriter supports writing using a mouse, keyboard, touch screen, one and two-step switch scanning, joystick and whiteboard. It also includes auditory scanning for people who are blind or have low vison. After selection, the word is written; a picture is automatically paired with that word and the picture is shown as the word is spoken. It supports 4, 16, 36 and 64 button setups. PixWriter uses the LSP Thesaurus to enhance the user&#x27;s ability to select homonym meanings or adjust the word bank for an individual&#x27;s needs. The PixCards feature also provides the ability to make PECS, flashcards or memory game cards. COMPATIBLITY: IBM and compatible computers or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7, Vista or XP, or Macintosh OS 10.4 or later; 600 megabytes (MB) of hard disk space.
