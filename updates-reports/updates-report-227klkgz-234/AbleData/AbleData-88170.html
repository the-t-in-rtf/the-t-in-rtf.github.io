                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Road to the Bank is an independent living personal skills tutorial program designed to teach children ages three and up about personal responsibility and money management. This product uses a game-style format to encourage children to complete daily chores such as making the bed, vacuuming, helping in the kitchen, doing homework, and others or to perform personal care activities such as brushing teeth and bathing. Responsibilities are illustrated on pre-printed chore cards and blank cards are also included for personalization. The large illustrations are labeled with the appropriate word, making the game accessible to both readers and non-readers. The basic set includes chore cards and playing pieces in four colors, allowing up to four children to participate. Children select their color and parents or caregivers select the appropriate chore cards for each child in his or her color. The brightly colored game board, depicting the road to the bank, is designed to be mounted on the refrigerator (repositionable mounting pads are included). Two hooks (color-coded for each child) are hung below the board. The left hook holds the chore cards to be completed for that day; as they are completed, the cards are moved to the right hook next to a smiling face. For each chore completed, the child moves his or her playing piece one space along the road to the bank (the board has 60 spaces). Smiling face cards (and extra spaces) can be awarded for extra chores or special efforts. When the player reaches the end of the road at the bank, he or she receives a reward, treat or allowance. For those receiving allowances, &quot;bank cards&quot; are provided to keep track of &quot;deposits&quot; and &quot;withdrawals&quot; and the reason for each transaction, enabling the child to learn money management skills. Each game set includes one game board, playing pieces in four colors, pre-printed chore cards in four colors, blank cards in four colors, a set of bank cards, and complete instructions and suggestions for customizing or personalizing the game. OPTIONS: Additional chore cards and banking cards for four players ($5 per set), a set of four blank banking cards only ($2), and three separate add-on card sets to expand the game: Learn-A-Verse Bible Verses ($2.99); Learn-to-Sign Sign Language alphabet and word cards ($2.99); Learn the USA cards ($2.99); and Keep Track of Allowance cards ($2.99). COLOR: Playing pieces and cards are red, yellow, blue, and green.
