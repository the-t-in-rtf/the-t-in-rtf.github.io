With BrailleMaster, the user can translate text to braille and send it either directly to a Braille embosser or printer or to an interim braille file; edit a file, including a braille file; print or emboss Braille from a Braille file; view the completed braille on screen; customize formatting and controls in a Braille embosser or printer; customize Braille rules or develop new Braille codes for text translation in many languages; and develop advanced Braille applications, such as math and music Braille code translators. The BrailleMaster package includes a Windows version of the Braille translator as well as two DOS versions: a screen-based, menu-driven version which also contains a text editor, and a command-line based version which is suitable for batch jobs and for use with screen readers. The bridge between the user and BrailleMaster&#x27;s translators is the Louis code. Louis is an easy-to-use symbolic language invented by Robotron and named for Louis Braille, the inventor of the Braille system of raised dot writing. The set of rules the user selects tells BrailleMaster how to translate the text into Braille. Users can construct or modify the Braille rules themselves. The Louis rules are contained in a text file which can be easily edited and immediately verified using BrailleMaster&#x27;s in-built rule verification facility. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Windows version of the BrailleMaster Braille translation program runs in Windows 95/98/NT/2000.
