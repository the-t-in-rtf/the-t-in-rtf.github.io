Once the user is in a note, the app offers a &quot;Review&quot; button for going into a read-only mode, and cursor tracking that always keeps the user&#x27;s place when he or she returns to a note. The app is compatible with both QWERTY and refreshable braille display keyboards that can connected to the host device, and it includes keyboard commands for both types of keyboards.
