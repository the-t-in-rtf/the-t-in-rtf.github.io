                    This page summarises a recent change to a vendor record associated with an entry in the unified listing.
                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

The glasses were created from off-the-shelf materials by PhD student William Abbott and Dr. Aldo Faisal, a lecturer in neurotechnology at Imperial College in the United Kingdom. The system has two basic components: (1) an eye tracking system that an individual wears on his or her head that consists of two sets of very fast cameras that record the movements of the eyes and enable researchers to work out where on the screen and individual is looking; and (2) software that decodes the intentions of an individual interacting with the computer and translates them into commands enabling the individual to control the computer just by using his or her eyes. In other words, the eyewear allows the wearer to operate the computer using only one&#x27;s eyes and move the cursor around as though there were a conventional mouse in place. The computer is calibrated to ignore involuntary blinking but all other controls are voluntarily implemented by the user. The system requires just one watt of power and is able to transmit data wirelessly. AUTHOR: Edwin Kee. TITLE: $65 brain interface glasses use eyes to control computers. WEBSITE: übergizmo.
