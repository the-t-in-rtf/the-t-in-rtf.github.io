                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>My House is an independent living skills and language tutorial software program designed to encourage discovery, learning, and communication about the objects of daily living for students with developmental, physical, or language learning disabilities or those with autism, traumatic brain injury, or aphasia. The program is designed to enhance functional language skills, increase understanding of objects and their functions or descriptions, and build independence as students identify objects by name and function in six rooms of a house. Settings include the bedroom, bathroom, dining room, kitchen, living room, and utility room. Four activities are available in each setting: Discover Names has the user select an object which is then named by the computer; Identify Names has the user identify objects named by the computer; Discover Functions and Descriptions has the user select an object which is then described by the computer; and, Identify Functions and Descriptions has the user locate an object described by the computer. The program allows instructors to select objects to be targeted. This program is also available in a bilingual version. Students with physical disabilities may gain access by using a TouchWindow (see separate entry).  COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a Pentium 133 megaHertz (MHz) or faster computer; a hard drive with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 16 megabytes (MB)RAM; a Windows compatible sound card; and a 4x speed CD drive. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 processor or PowerPC; System 7.5 or later; 8 MB application RAM; and a 4x speed CD-ROM.
