This is the first in a CD-ROM series with stories that happen in the neighborhood of Paws, the signing dog. Each piece of software in the series contains three stories and 10 games. In addition to Paws, there is a central group of characters (neighborhood children), most of whom are deaf, hard of hearing, or multiply disabled, and represent different ethnic groups. Each CD-ROM is named for a street in Pawstown. In each opening menu, the child can click on a building or area of the street to reach a menu for a story that relates to that neighborhood feature (e.g., library, playground, restaurant). The stories use repetition, patterned language, and predictable structure to encourage early reading skills. Some stories are interactive. Viewing options include audio and video clips of signing. The games concentrate on reading decoding, vocabulary building, signing skills, visual memory, visual perception, visual/motor coordination, early concepts such as categorization and matching, computer skills, and math. In addition to stories and games, each CD-ROM in the series includes a dictionary of vocabulary used in the software. Each word in the dictionary is shown in print, with a graphic depicting the concept and a line drawing of the related sign, as well as an option to view a video of the sign. The dictionary pages can be printed. The first CD in the Pawstown series, Woof Woof Way, includes stories about the Pet Store, the Toy Store and the Library, along with ASL stories in the ASL Video Store, and a visit to the Institute for Disabilities Research and Training (IDRT) office. The accompanying games include sequencing story events, completing sentences, designing an animal, identifying an object from its parts, counting money to pay for items in a story, categorizing items, designing a book cover, and spelling words.
