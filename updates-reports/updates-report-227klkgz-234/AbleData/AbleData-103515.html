This application (or &quot;app&quot;) is designed for use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to notify the user&#x27;s friends, family members or caregivers of the exact location of him or her. The first time the user starts the program, he or she can enter and save email addresses of people to be notified of his or her location. The user launches Community Sidekick at the beginning of a trip, and the program sends an email with the time and current location of the user. The program then automatically sends out a &quot;Current Location&quot; email at the selected time interval, which can be 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. Settings can be changed by touching and holding the title bar for five seconds. The user can also tap and hold the &quot;MESSAGE&quot; button for three seconds and select the button &quot;I am OK&quot; or &quot;Please Contact Me&quot; to send out an email message. When the user arrives at his or her destination or back home, he or she taps and holds the &quot;DONE&quot; button to automatically send out an email message with current time and location information. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
