This computer-based instructional program uses a three-dimensional animated agent, a talking head called Timo, to help children practice identifying, hearing, and saying new words. Timo engages each student in conversation and addresses them by name as he takes them through personalized, interactive lessons that include 127 vocabulary-building lessons covering more than 650 words and images drawn from kindergarten through 4th grade curriculums. The lessons have eight customizable levels of practice: pre-test, presentation, identification, reading, spelling, imitation, elicitation, and post-test. Subject areas and topics include animals and insects, space, the human body, weather, water cycles, and dozens more. Lessons have complete captioning that can be turned on or off. Recordings of student speech and articulation are made so they can be heard by therapists, teachers, or parents. Children receive customizable and colorful reward animations for correct answers, and are provided with cheerful, personalized My Work reports. A password-protected administration area contains tools for teachers, specialists, and parents, which can be used to create and edit student profiles, generate detailed reports of students&#x27; progress for inclusion in IEPs, and play back student recordings to monitor vocabulary and articulation progress. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM or compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: IBM compatible computers require Windows 98 or higher operating system, 600 megaHertz (MHz) processor, and 128 megabytes RAM. Apple Macintosh computers require Mac OS 9.2 or higher operating system, 400 MHz processor, and 128 megabytes RAM. For all computers, a 16-bit color or higher monitor, Sound Blaster or compatible 16-bit sound card, speaker or headphones, microphone, CD-ROM drive, and 300 megabytes (MB) disk space.
