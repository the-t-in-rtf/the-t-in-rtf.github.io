Colorful elephants carrying whimsical characters on their heads lead children into six activities with opportunities for experimentation, problem solving, language development, fine motor skill development, sound discrimination, and more. Children experiment with an on-screen machine to figure out how to make sausages and then squeeze them into a hungry monster&#x27;s dish. The Make a Body activity enables children to choose from three levels of difficulty to build a series of matching cartoon-style bodies while sharpening visual discrimination skills. Funny animations and sounds play automatically as rewards. Another activity has users creating a symphony and experimenting with rhythm with the Monster Band, a collection of pink blob-like creatures distinguished by features like a trumpet nose, a twanging tongue, and a huge tapping shoe. Children help the gardener keep his flowers alive in the Watering the Flowers activity. The flowers have their own sound effects which decrease as the flowers begin to droop. Sprinkling them with water from the gardener&#x27;s watering can revives them. Dog&#x27;s Long Walk helps users hone hand-eye coordination. Navigation buttons on the bottom of the screen allow children to move the dog from left to right and up and down so he can investigate a variety of objects and occasionally take a dip in a pond. Finally, characters from Leaps and Bounds 1 and 2 (see separate entries) appear in Noisy Painting, where black-and-white outlines can be filled in with brilliant colors using an on-screen paintbrush. Children dip the brush in the color of their choice and are treated to sound effects as they complete each painting. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible or Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The IBM and compatible version requires a P-133 processor, 32 megabytes (MB) RAM minimum (64 MB recommended), Windows 95 or higher, CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound card, and a 800 x 600 256-color monitor. The Macintosh version requires a 68040 or better processor, Operating System 8.5 or higher, a 2X CD-ROM drive, a 800 x 600 256-color monitor, and Sound Manager 3.1 or later.
