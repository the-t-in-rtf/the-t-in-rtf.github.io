This software scans documents and reads scanned or electronic text aloud using synthetic speech. Words are highlighted in contrasting colors as they are spoken. This simultaneous auditory and visual presentation of information helps increase reading accuracy, speed, and comprehension for readers. Users can adjust how much text is highlighted and the speed at which text is read. In classroom use, curriculum materials can be scanned and read by students with learning disabilities at their own pace. Text editing features allow students to correct their written work. Kurzweil 3000 Scan/Read for Macintosh has both optical character recognition and document reading capabilities. Kurzweil 3000 Read Station for Macintosh has only document reading capability, and is intended for students who obtain scanned materials from their teachers. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Power Macintosh computer (Power PC, iMac, iBook, G3, G4, or Powerbook) running Mac OS version 7.6.1 or later; 64 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM); 100 MB of hard disk space; CD-ROM drive; and TWAIN-compliant scanner (for scan/read version).
