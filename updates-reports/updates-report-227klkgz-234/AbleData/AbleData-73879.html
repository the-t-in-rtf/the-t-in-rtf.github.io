                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>Paws Signs Stories is an American Sign Language (ASL) training program designed for use by children who are deaf or hard of hearing. It consists of a computer software CD-ROM with five stories and 15 educational games (three for each story). The stories are designed to teach early ASL skills, including visual discrimination, facial expression, sign location, and signs accompanied by movement (classifiers). The stories use repetition, patterned language, and predictable structure to encourage early reading skills. The games concentrate on reading decoding, vocabulary building, signing skills, visual memory, visual perception, visual/motor coordination, early concepts such as categorization and matching, computer skills, and math. For example, one game for the story &quot;Time to Wash&quot; requires the child to sort clothes by type into laundry baskets, and to count the number of items put in and taken out. Another game for that story teaches the English spelling and ASL fingerspelling for colors and types of clothing. Linda Bove, the deaf actress on Sesame Street, signs the stories, directions, and game items, dressed as Paws the dog. The CD comes with a User&#x27;s Guide. OPTIONS: Available with or without a set of five storybooks. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 166 megahertz (MHz) Pentium processor; Windows 95, 95 Plus, 98, or NT operating system; 32 megabytes (MB) memory; 16X or better CD-ROM; 15 MB hard disk; 15-inch SVGA color monitor with 16-bit or more colors and capacity to set the screen size to 800 by 600 pixels and small fonts.
