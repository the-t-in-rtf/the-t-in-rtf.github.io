This collection of educational activities features a range of integrated support materials to effectively use the computer as a whole language tool in the classroom. This program uses an original story to introduce users to five habitats: the jungle, the desert, the grasslands, the mountains, and the Arctic. Students follow the story on the computer and then explore each habitat. The program includes more than 20 software activitiesthat teach phonics, language comprehension, and animal facts; an original storybook, and a corresponding overlay; five environments, each with a separate overlay for accessing animated computer activities; and a Teacher&#x27;s Resource Guide with extension activities and blackline masters. Software activities include Animal Facts, Who Am I? (comprehension), Silly Rhymes (reinforces initial sounds and rhyming), Listen to the Sounds (introduces initial sounds), and Read (replays text as often as desired). The program also offers two extra quizzes for each environment and two advance overlays that introduce counting and beginning writing skills. This program is compatible with IntelliTalk (see separate entry), includes the IntelliPics (see separate entry) player, as well as graphics files and modified overlays which can be edited and printed in Overlay Maker (see separate entry).  COMPATIBILITY: For use on Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Any Macintosh system with a hard drive, a color monitor, System 7 or higher, 8 megabytes (MB) RAM, and IntelliKeys. IntelliTalk is recommended, but not required.
