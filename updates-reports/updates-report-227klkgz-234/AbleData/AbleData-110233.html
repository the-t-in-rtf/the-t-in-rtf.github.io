This program enables a computer to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak. Text typed into the program is spoken, and words and phrases can be custom set to be spoken with a mouse click or keystroke. The program can also speak messages associated with image-based speech panels designed with AssistiveWare&#x27;s LayoutKitchen using Picture Communication Symbols from Mayer-Johnson (not included). The program speaks text and other keystrokes typed in any application, and speaks screen objects such as buttons, menus, and text below the cursor in most applications. It provides very large icons and resizable toolbars, and can convert text to audio files or iPod-ready iTunes tracks. A basic text editor is included that can speak as the user types, and can also speak individual words, sentences and paragraphs. The program also provides a multilingual speech engine for AssistiveWare&#x27;s KeyStrokes on-screen keyboard and SwitchXS switch access (not included; see separate entries). It works with all the built-in voices of Mac OS X, and includes Acapela voices for one of the following languages: US English, UK English, German, Dutch, Flemish, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, or Brazilian Portuguese. OPTIONS: Acapela voices for additional languages and a bundle with Infovox iVox, which provides voices that work both in this program and system-wide. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Mac OS X 10.3 Panther or Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger operating system and minimal screen resolution of 800 x 600 pixels.
