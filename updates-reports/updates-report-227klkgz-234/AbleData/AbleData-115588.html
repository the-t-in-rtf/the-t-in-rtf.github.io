This application (or app) allows a parent to use their Apple iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch or Android phone to encourage a child to recognize and express their emotions. The user launches AutismXpress Pro and selects one of three available games: Feeling Finder, Emotion Matching and Expression Question. For the Feeling Finder game, the user touches the game&#x27;s icon, selects an emotion icon on the screen and the chosen emotion will appear on the screen along with sounds expressing that emotion. Sounds can be turned off and available emotions include: Sleepy, Sad, Angry, Happy, Hungry, Nervous, Burpy, Surprised, Hicupy, Sneezy, Sickly, and Gassy. For the Emotion Matching game, icons covered with question marks appear on the screen, and the user touches icons one by one to uncover them until two identical icons are uncovered. For the Expression Question game, three different icons appear on the screen and a word such as &quot;Sleepy&quot; appears on top of the icons. The user selects the emotion that matches the word. COMPATIBILITY: For use with an Apple iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android phone. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later, Android 2.2 or later.
