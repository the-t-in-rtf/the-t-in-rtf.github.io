The curriculum offers thematic units based on stories or songs. Each adventure begins with a printed storybook and features up to 35 activities utilizing patterned language, familiar refrains, and engaging interactive animations. It comes with an answer checking feature so that teachers can assess the student’s progress, and an extensive PDF resource document full of printable games and away-from-the-computer activities.
                                Students can engage in and learn from the following ReadyMade® Story Kits’ adventures:
                                •	Colorful Caterpillar: Students are introduced to the concepts of colors and numbers while following the metamorphic process of the caterpillar. The 35 supplemental activities teach quantity recognition, simple addition and subtraction, symmetry and pattern, phonics, sentence building, and comprehension.
                                •	Five Cuddly Teddies: Students count backward as each of the five cuddly teddies goes its way until there are none. Within the engaging bear theme, students practice 35 supplemental activities and explore early math concepts, operations, position concepts, classification, reading, phonics, comprehension, and writing.
                                •	Animal Habitats: Early learners travel with the Curious Polar Bear to five habitats - jungle, grasslands, mountains, arctic, and desert. The 35 thematic activities provide practice in comprehension, writing, phonics, classification, number concepts, math operations, patterns, and more. [“Animal Habitats” is also sold separately; please see separate entry.]
                                ReadyMade® Story Kits can run on Windows and Macintosh.
