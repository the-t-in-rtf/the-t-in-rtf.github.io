The main work area can be adjusted with a hand crank in order to accommodate a variety of wheelchair heights. This mechanism has an internal braking system. There are additional side brakes to insure stability of the table during operation. The workstations will accommodate a microcomputer, a monitor, a printer, external disk drives, printer paper, an expanded keyboard, and other necessary materials. Two models are available: The HCP-4800 ($1095) and the HCP-6000 ($1195). Both models have keyboard trays made to hold an oversize keyboard such as the Unicorn Pad (Unicorn Engineering; see separate entry), the TASH King Keyboard, or the P.T.P. Pad. HCP-4800: This model has a rollout, adjustable angle shelf which rests on the arms of the wheelchair. HCP-6000: This model has the same physical dimensions and adjustable crank mechanism as the HCP-4800, but provides the user with a U-shaped shelf with a cutout to offer support surfaces on either side of the body and gives the operator close access to the keyboard tray. This shelf adjusts from 45 degrees down to 30 degrees, and can be folded up and locked into a horizontal position. DIMENSIONS (DxWxH): Overall workstation dimensions are 24 x 48 x 42 inches; desk height adjusts from 26 to 33.5 inches. WEIGHT: 225 pounds.
