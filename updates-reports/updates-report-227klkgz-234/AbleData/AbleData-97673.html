Clyde In Fly Ball Interactive CD-ROM is a story program designed to promote literacy, reading and language involvement for children with cognitive disabilities. The program features animated imaginative characters (K.C. is a boy; Clyde is a dog, and UKandu is the wordbird), catchy music and fun word recognition activities. It is designed with up to 21 story paths (more than 120 pages of story is possible), four levels of word interaction, and pop quizzes. The characters are engineered to talk directly to the users by asking questions, enabling the user to become the story&#x27;s author by having to make choices that determine the story&#x27;s direction. The user is also offered the option of saving their spot in the story so they can continue later on and the option of printing the story&#x27;s text. You may purchase the CD-ROM alone ($79.00) or with the Literacy Learning Materials ($99.00) that feature both on- and off-computer activities to promote word recognition, critical thinking and expression of ideas. Learning Materials are available for separate purchase ($29.00). Other recommended access is available through TouchWindow (see separate entry) and Ke:nx (see separate entry). COMPATIBILITY: Macintosh LC II or higher. It also works with the Macintosh Switch Interface and a single switch. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 8 MB RAM; System 7; 256 bit color monitor; 300 speed for CD-ROM drive; OPTIONS: User-5 Pack are available.
