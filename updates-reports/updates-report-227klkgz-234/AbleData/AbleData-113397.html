The spoken text is transferred automatically to the clipboard where it can be magnified for users with visual impairments. An icon in the clipboard enables the user to switch the screen reading on and off with a single click. Web pages can be read in a variety of European languages with native voices. The program speaks back text as the user writes. The device can be configured to speak each letter as it is typed, each word as it is completed, or each sentence. It can read words from the prediction list when the user points at them, when they are chosen, or automatically when they change. It can also read back whole paragraphs (or more) of text from other applications using the clipboard. While speaking text from the clipboard, a window can be shown which follows the voice, highlighting each word as it goes. The user can click on a word to hear it again, or to have a fragment of the text spoken. This can be used in conjunction with the screen reader to enlarge and highlight words being read from web pages or the desktop. The program comes with English voices from CereProc (Heather, Sarah, and Katherine), which are installed using the standard SAPI protocol. The program&#x27;s screen reader can read and highlight alterative spellings, synonyms, and dictionary meanings available in Microsoft Word. OPTIONS: French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Swedish versions; North American version including English and Spanish. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Microsoft Windows Vista, XP, 2000, or NT 4.
