The software provides graphic representations of vocal sounds on a color monitor. A variety of games and visual displays aid in vowel production, word articulation, pitch and volume control, duration, inflection, speaking rate, connected speech, and other elements of speech. The therapist controls the program content, reward levels, and other aspects of operation and can customize the program for individuals in their caseloads.  Visual models and their audio components can be stored for reuse, and are adjustable to reflect each individual speaker&#x27;s production, as well as changes or improvements. Single session performance and cross-time progress can be tracked with built-in recordkeeping and reporting facilities. Only a microphone is required for voice capture and replay; the Logitech USB microphone is recommended and provided with purchase (US only). Software updates are available at no charge and available for download at www.videovoice.com.  Toll free phone and email technical support are available as needed. COMPATIBILITY: For use on personal computers (desktop or laptop) with the Windows Operating System and on Macintosh computers which support Windows. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  Windows 98, 2000, NT, XP or Vista; CD-ROM drive; sound card and speakers; color monitor; one USB port; a minimum of 32 megabytes (MB) RAM; and 50 MB hard drive space. A printer is optional (required to print reports). The Logitech USB Desktop microphone is recommended (provided with purchase in the US).
