This application (or app) allows a therapist or parent to use an Apple iPad to help children to learn the words for basic objects in any or all of the following languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Hindi and Russian. The app includes 50 objects shown in 10 or more ways and provides three different activities: Learn the Word, Find the Word (receptive vocabulary) and Say the Word (expressive vocabulary). The child is taught the name for the word by a native speaker of the selected language by hearing and seeing it five times in the Learn the Word activity. The child is shown five pictures and is asked to find the requested object in the Find the Word activity. The Say the Word activity comes with a spinner and recording feature. After the child speaks the word for the selected object, the word is then played back, and the user can compare what was said to the model for that word in the chosen language. Optional features include animations for correct answers; picture choice so that the app displays photographs, color drawings or chooses randomly); turning text on or off to focus on reading skills or listening skills, respectively; and data collection for up to 15 children. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.3 or later.
