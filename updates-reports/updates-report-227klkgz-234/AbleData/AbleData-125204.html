Features include:
                                
                                
                                	Instead of multiple layers of menus, the three important navigation elements are on the lower portion of every screen: Route, POIs and Location.
                                	At intersections, the cross street and its orientation are announced
                                	Intersections are described (e.g. four-way) with the clock face orientation of the streets.
                                	There are two choices for POI data (Google Places and Foursquare).
                                	Directions are configured appropriately for Pedestrian and Vehicle routes, including heads-up announcements for approaching turns, turn now, continue straight and upcoming turns. 
                                	If the user wanders off the route, it&#x27;s automatically recalculated and updated turn information is announced.
                                	Nearby Points of interest and intersections are automatically announced.
                                	Ability to run in the background or with the screen locked for iOS 7.
