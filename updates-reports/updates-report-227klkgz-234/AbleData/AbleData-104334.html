The Ohio State University Time Team (TT), in partnership with the Down Syndrome Association of Central Ohio (DSACO), partnered to design a time management device for children with Down syndrome. The device is intended to increase the self-sufficiency of children by enabling them to manage their time independently. It provides a tool to aid children to learn the concepts of time, relationships between the timing of multiple events, and sequential reasoning. The device mitigates the frequency of occasions that a caregiver must remind the child to stay on task. It serves two main functions: (1) providing a visual sequence of events and (2) displaying a proportional amount of time. This device presents time and events in a simple and effective way using multiple sensory stimuli that specifically address the cognitive and physical disabilities of children with Down syndrome. The time device portrays several tasks in chronological order, shows the expected duration of each task in relation to its surrounding events, and depicts elapsed and remaining time for the event series using a dynamic proportional LED light bar. The LED bar is capable of displaying up to five separate colors, indicating lengths of time for the five different tasks. The user chooses the lengths of time by way of potentiometer knobs and those lengths program into the device upon each use. The lights turn off at a constant rate as time passes, showing a decrease in the length of time left. Pictures of the event tasks lay over individual backgrounds whose colors correspond to the colors on the LED. Based on results from validation testing of preliminary concepts conducted with 21 parents of children with Down syndrome, the device employs interactive features to provide the child a sense of accomplishment. The device provides visual reinforcement for the completion of a task by closing a window over the event&#x27;s picture. Closing the window also closes a circuit loop, activating a positive sound. The device is robust, portable and adaptable. It has visual appeal, is easy to use, and requires minimal set up time. The total project cost is $2529.97.
