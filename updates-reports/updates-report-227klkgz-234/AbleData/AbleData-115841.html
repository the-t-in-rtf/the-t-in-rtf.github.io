This individual has limited mobility, can only lift her arms to her chest, and cannot bend her neck.  She mostly relies on Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software since she can only type for a short time without pain; however, she is unable to put on or take off the microphone headset by herself. Designers observed that she was able to manipulate sticks well so an adaptation was created using two pieces of dowel, tapered at both ends with a rubber stopper about three centimeters from the ends. These fit snuggly into lugs, which are fitted onto the headset with a stopper preventing the stick from slipping out of the lug. She can then ask her caregiver to place the headset on, and when she is finished, she can manipulate the sticks into the lugs and remove the headset herself. TITLE: Adapted spoon and headset. JOURNAL: TAD Journal. REF: Volume 31, Number 2, Autumn 2011: p. 12. PAGES: 2 with cover.
