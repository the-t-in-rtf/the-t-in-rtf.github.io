This device can be controlled by joysticks, switches, matrix keyboards, or communication aids and supplies Morse Code, scanning, matrix keyboard, Darci Code, and communication aid access to all computer functions.The input device is selected by a setup menu which is displayed on DARCI TOO&#x27;s display panel. Input devices are connected to one of the three input connectors. Setup routines are built into the unit that enable the user to customize how the unit will be used. Joystick axis and switch contacts can be reassigned, operating modes can be selected, and joysticks can be calibrated with these routines. All timing functions can be adjusted from .01 seconds to 10 seconds. All of these functions can be accessed by the user and they can be changed at any time. Five operating modes are available: DARCI Code, scan mode, matrix keyboard mode, communication aid mode, and Morse Code. The unit is equipped with a two-line, 80- character display. This display provides the user with all the information needed to use this device successfully. In the Scan Mode, the unit displays the keyboard characters being scanned. In the Morse Code mode, the display shows the dots and dashes as they are being entered and provides a continuous display of keyboard functions (control, alternate, caps lock, etc.) In the DARCI Code mode, the unit displays the joystick positions as they are entered as well as the keyboard functions. In the matrix keyboard mode, it displays the key which was pressed as well as the keyboard functions. While running the setup routines, the display panel provides the user with full instructions, as well as a display of all the current timing parameters and control options. The unit can send a computer any of the characters or commands which are normally sent by a keyboard. It also has the ability to send the computer whole words (Morse Code, DARCI Code, and scan modes only). This device contains reprogrammable memory which the user can use to store sets of characters which can be recalled (e.g., a name and address can be stored and sent to the computer with a single command). DARCI TOO will retain this vocabulary indefinitely, even when power has been removed. This device has also been has been provided with the ability to control IBM&#x27;s Screen Reader. In this mode, DARCI TOO replaces both the Screen Reader keypad and the keyboard. For users with limited vision, an optional magnifying lens is available for DARCI TOO&#x27;s display panel. This device has an aluminum case and has been designed to be placed either under or on top of a computer monitor. In these positions the unit&#x27;s display panel is always in view. DARCI TOO has also been equipped with tilt up feet so that the display is visible when the unit is placed on a table or workstation. All software is contained within the unit and it comes with its own power supply, enabling setups to be run without using a computer. The system includes a user&#x27;s manual, a video tutorial, and a set of interface cables for the computer of the user&#x27;s choice. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Apple, Macintosh, and IBM and compatible personal computers. OPTIONS: Magnifier for the display, additional cables to enable the unit to control both Apple and IBM computers, an optional interface card which allows the DARCI TOO to control an APPLE IIe, and others. DIMENSIONS (WxLxH): 9.5 x 10.5 x 2.75 inches. WARRANTY: Full one-year warranty and a 30-day trial period.
