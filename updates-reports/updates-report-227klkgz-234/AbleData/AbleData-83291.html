This Plug-n-Play keyboard has a concave shape to provide tactile feedback which improves accuracy and speed. The keyboard has a standard QWERTY letter layout with an optional advanced Maltron letter layout which gives a ten to one reduction in finger movement. The alphabet keys are in two groups on the left and right of the keyboard; the numeric keypad is in the center; and the command keys (CTRL, ALT, etc.) are in two thumb groups beneath the numeric keys. The Maltron Keyboards have all the functions of a standard keyboard and are available in the following languages: British English, American English, Spanish, and most European languages. The Maltron Keyboards also have the ability to turn off key repeating if it is not required or to alter the repeat rate setting to Slow, Medium or Fast. TRAINING: An adaption/familiarization course is included with the CD which accompanies each keyboard. OPTIONS: Track ball. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers or Apple Macintosh computers with a USB or PS/2 port. DIMENSIONS (LxWxH): 17 x 8.5 x 3.8 inches. WEIGHT: 2 pounds. COLOR: Available in grey and black. WARRANTY: 1-year warranty.
