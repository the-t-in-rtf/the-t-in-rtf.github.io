The RollerMouse PRO features a cylindrical rollerbar, five buttons, and a scroll wheel to perform all of the functions of a standard mouse. The rubber-coated steel rollerbar rotates to move the mouse pointer vertically, and it slides horizontally to move the mouse pointer in the same direction. There are two narrow buttons immediately below the rollerbar that function as the left and right buttons of a standard mouse for an IBM personal computer (PC). The rollerbar can also be clicked, and the click force for the rollerbar is adjustable. The other three large buttons can be configured to perform functions such as single click, double click, and drag lock. The RollerMouse PRO includes a keyboard tray with a soft, lycra-covered wrist rest at the base that can be removed for cleaning. The wrist rest is divided into two sections by the rollerbar, buttons, and scroll wheel, which are located just to the left of center. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM PC or compatible computers and Apple Macintosh computers (USB device with PS2 adapter included). SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: No drivers required to operate the mouse; some operating systems require a driver for the scroll wheel. OPTIONS: Extended RollerWave wrist rest. DIMENSIONS (HxLxW): 1.25 x 20.875 x 11.75 inches. The rollerbar is 6.8125 inches long. COLOR: Black. WARRANTY: 2-year warranty.
