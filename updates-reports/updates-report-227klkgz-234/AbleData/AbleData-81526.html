The interactive program features a dictionary of more than 2,000 words that can be set to any one of three levels: children, teen, or adult. The child&#x27;s dictionary is designed for early or non-readers. The program demonstrates the American Sign Language (ASL) sign for a selected word in full-motion video and it provides the user with the option of watching the video once or repeatedly. Also included are learning games at each level such as Crossword Puzzle and You First! for adults and teens and Tic Tac Toe and The Match Game for children. Other features include signs for fingerspelling, everyday phrases, conversational signing, basic ASL rules and conventions, and a bibliography of resources about sign language and Deaf Culture. The program also offers a Student Manager used to create rosters of those using the program, a Tracking Manager to automatically track student use, a List Manager to allow sets of words to be selected for the games, a Vocabulary Manager to enable editing of the dictionary and to restrict access to any word or group of words, and a Bibliography Manager to enable the user to edit or add resources to the on-line bibliographies. Security features prevent use of these features by unauthorized individuals. The package includes a CD-ROM, installation diskettes, and a User Guide. COMPATIBILITY: Versions are available for use on Macintosh or IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Macintosh computers: System 7, four megabytes (MB) of Random Access Memory (RAM), 10 MB free hard disk space, a 2-speed CD-ROM drive, a 1.44 MB floppy disk drive, and a color or gray scale monitor. For IBM and compatible computers: Windows 3.1 or Windows95, eight MB RAM, six MB free hard disk space, a 2-speed CD-ROM drive, a VGA monitor (256 colors), a Windows-compatible sound card, and QuickTime for Windows
