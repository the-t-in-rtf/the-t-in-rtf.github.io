The unit is equipped with a 6-foot cord and will work as far as 50 feet away from the computer. This combination unit is good for individuals who do computer work from a bed, one-handed individuals, or individuals with difficulties accessing a keyboard and a mouse. The Twiddler has three rows of keys on the front surface. Each row is designated by a color. An oval patter of small round buttons on the top back curve of the Twiddler provides thumb control of Alt, Control, Shift, Function, and number keys, as well as control of the unit&#x27;s mouse capabilities. KEYBOARD: The ergonomic design of the Twiddler allows &quot;chord&quot; keying, or the ability to press one or more keys at a time. Each key command generates a unique character or command. Twelve finger keys and six thumb keys emulate more than 101 standard keyboard keys. This touch-type unit can be used as an auxiliary keyboard varying the potential stress from repetitive motions. MOUSE: The mouse pointer has an electrolytic tilt sensor sealed inside the unit, providing immunity from dust and dirt that shortens the life of ordinary mice and tracballs. By pressing the mouse button on top of the unit and pointing an index finger in the direction the user wants the device to tilet, the user controls the cursor on the screen. No mouse pad, desktop, or other surface is needed for operation of the mouse. A &quot;joystick&quot; mode is included for mouse-driven games. COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS: IBM PC/XT/AT or PS/2 computer (optional PS/2 keyboard adapter required); keyboard and serial ports; DOS 3.1 and higher; Windows 3.0 and higher. WARRANTY: 3 years.
