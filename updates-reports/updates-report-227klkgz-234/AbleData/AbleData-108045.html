                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>First Verbs Sterling Edition is a language and vocabulary tutorial program designed for use by children and adults with language-learning, developmental, physical, visual, or hearing disabilities, or autism. This program provides highly-structured training of early developing verbs. The program trains 50 words in developmental order, but focuses on only five words at a time. Two different animated illustrations are used in training the words. Words are presented either in isolation or with one other on the screen. Users can choose to work on a black or full-scene background. Optimized Intervention technology begins with a probe test to identify five words the student does not already know. During training, students are presented with two pictures and asked to identify one of them (e.g. &quot;Find eating.&quot;) The program monitors each student response and automatically adjusts the training level(one through five) of each word. At the lower levels of training, a character known as the Blob reinforces correct answers with his amusing antics. At the higher levels of training, a new character named Zot uses expanded language. Zot&#x27;s speech includes the use of a variety of verb inflections in varying contexts. Each time a word is mastered, a new word enters into training. At the end of each lesson, a summary of the student’s performance is presented, allowing the instructor to review the student’s progress and ensure accountability. The program also includes the Sterling Administration System, a set of tools that eases student management, simplifies data analysis, and offers new report-writing options. A verb card deck is included with the program. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Macintosh and IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version for IBM and compatible computers requires a 300 MegaHertz (MHz)or faster processor; a hard drive with Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP or later; 64 megabytes (MB) RAM; 40 MB available disk space; a Windows compatible sound card; and an 8x speed CD-ROM. The Macintosh version requires a PowerPC with a 300 MHz or faster processor; Mac OS 8.1 or later, including OS X; 128 MB RAM, (256 MB RAM for OS X); 40 MB available disk space; and an 8x speed CD-ROM.
