The system consists of two seven-key keyboards which are angled and have palm rests. The keyboards are capable of entering all the functions and characters of the traditional QWERTY keyboard and more. Letters, characters, and symbols are selected by pressing a combination of keys, similar to chords on a piano. One or two hands can be used to enter data. The user can assign chords to words, phrases, and macros. The BAT keyboards do not interfere with the use of the standard keyboard and can be positioned anywhere. The BAT keyboards can be used singly (left or right models), in pairs (dual system), and in conjunction with a standard keyboard, mouse, or other input devices. BAT keyboards include cables, software, reference guide, and manuals. COMPATIBILITY: Models are available for use with IBM and compatible personal computers and Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 256 kilobytes of random access memory (RAM), MS-DOS 3.1 or later; COM1, COM2, or LPT1 ports. OPTIONS: Promotional video, carrying case, keyboard cover, keyboard skin, low vision reference guide, Braille reference guide, and manual on cassette. WEIGHT: Each keyboard weighs less than 1 pound. COLOR: White with five white, one red, and one blue key. WARRANTY: 30-day money back guarantee.
