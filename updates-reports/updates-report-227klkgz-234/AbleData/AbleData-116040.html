The mount is non-directional and can be installed on either side of the wheelchair. This product also can be removed from the wheelchair when not needed. The frame clamp assembly includes an inner piece and a removable receiver. The inner piece is bolted or clamped to the wheelchair frame while the receiver holds a vertical tube that extends upward and bends at a right angle over the users legs or lap. The mounted device is attached either directly or with a specific adapter to a quick release plate, and attached to the horizontal end of the mount assembly by a quick release base that secures the device and allows for quick detaching of the device from the mount. The complete mount can be lifted out of the receiver and removed from the wheelchair leaving only the frame clamp assembly attached to the wheelchair frame, and swung away when the adjustable height clamp lock handle is loosened. DIMENSIONS (HxW): Standard configuration: 24 x 14 inches. Optional tubes: 20 x 14, 28 x 14, 32 x 14, 20 x 16, 24 x 16, 28 x 16,  and 32 x 16 inches. CAPACITY: 10 pounds.
