The system allows a person to use adapted switches or the driving controls of their powered wheelchair to control remotely an Apple iPod Touch, iPhone or iPad or an Android tablet or smartphone. The Tecla Access app (see separate entry) is required to use the Tecla Shield DOS with an Android device. The switches or driving controls connect to the system using the included cables through the device&#x27;s six ports. The ports include two 3.5-millimeter stereo sockets, a D-Sub 9-pin male connector ECU port, a USB micro Type B port, and a 2.1-millimeter center-positive barrel socket (7-24 Volt). The system connects via Bluetooth without a PIN pairing code. The system transmits switch events wirelessly up to 18 meters in range and transmits both switch press and release events to the mobile device. There is no delay in switch event transmission, and the system comes with built-in switch noise filtering. The Tecla Shield DOS allows the user to explore the device&#x27;s home screen and launch applications as well as navigating and interacting with the built-in apps on iOS or Android devices to take photographs, listen to music, browse the internet, make phone calls and watch videos. This device also allows the user to access the on-screen keyboard to compose e-mails and messages or enter text. The Tecla Shield DOS allowse single switch access to Siri on iOS or Google voice assistant and to the voice dictation key in the iOS or Android built-in keyboards. DIMENSIONS (LxWxH): 3.5 x 3.25 x 1.5 inches. WEIGHT: 200 grams. WARRANTY: 1-year limited warranty.
