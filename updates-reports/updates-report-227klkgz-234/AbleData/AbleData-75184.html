Triple Talk PCI makes use of the high speed transfer rates of the PCI bus and the latest in advanced Double-Talk techology to produce a high quality of speech. The Triple-Talk PCI has eight predefined voices, 10 volume levels, 10 different speeds, and 100 unique pitches, and is fully configurable by the user. Parameters such as tone, punctuation filtering, and intonation are also adjustable. The user&#x27;s ability to take advantage of these options may be limited by certain software packages such as screen access programs. This synthesizer supports screen reader programs such as Window Eyes, JAWS for Windows, Vocal Eyes, and Asap (see separate entries); optical character recognition (OCR)  reading machine products such as OpenBook 3.5, Ruby, and Kurzweil; and screen magnification programs such as Zoomtext (see entries). Triple-Talk PCI comes with an external mono speaker for delivering its synthesized speech output. In addition, the external speaker is equipped with a volume knob and a 0.125-inch headphone jack. The unit also comes with an installation disk and a Quick Reference data sheet. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM or compatible micro computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 33 Megahertz (MHz) PCI bus; Windows 3.x, Windows 9x (including DOS Boxes and straight DOS mode), Windows Millennium, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or MS-DOS 6.22.
