The application (or app) allows a child to use an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to practice sounds in words and sentences with a therapist, parent, or independently. The program can be used to collect scores in flash cards on up to four children at a time and contains a deck of 40 “th” cards. A sound group such as “beginning th” is selected from the deck and practiced in full-featured flashcard and matching activities. In the flash card activity, the sound group can be shuffled to individualized practice for children with both the words alone and in sentences. In the matching activity, the words are randomized in three levels: easy (three pairs), medium (six pairs), and hard (10 pairs). Other features include: color-code cards, auto-play of audio recordings, tap-to-play audio, voice recording and playing, data saving organized by names and timestamps, and data copy to clipboard/email. Twenty additional decks of flash cards are available and can be purchased individually while using the app. A paid version of this app, ArtikPix-Full (see separate entry), is available with all 21 flash card decks. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
