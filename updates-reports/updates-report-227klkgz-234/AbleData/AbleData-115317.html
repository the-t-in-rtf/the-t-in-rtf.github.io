It is designed to remind people to take their medications at the proper times and in the proper amounts. This application (or app) stores details of each medication the user needs to take, including quantity purchased, frequency and dosage, an image of the medication, prescribing doctors, individual prescriptions, and notes on the medication. Based on this information, MediMemory sends the user reminders when it is time to take each medication. Upon receiving a reminder, the user can indicate whether he/she has taken the medicine, wants to be reminded again later, or has skipped taking the medicine this time. The response provided is used to track the amount of medicine currently at home. When the user&#x27;s medicine stock is getting low, MediMemory provides a warning and offers a shopping list of all medicines that should be purchased. MediMemory also offers access to the user&#x27;s medicine usage history, schedule change history, travel tools (including schedule adjustments for time zone changes), and storage of information on the user&#x27;s medical condition. Available languages are English and German. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
