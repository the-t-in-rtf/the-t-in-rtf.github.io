                                <ins><img class="gpii-diff-zeropx" aria-label="Begin inserted content."/>The Eye-Pal is an optical character recognition device designed for use by individuals who are blind or deaf blind. This portable USB scanner/reader connects to a computer and instantly converts printed material into speech, text files, or refreshable Braille (when used with a Braille display from manufacturers such as Freedom Scientific, Optelec, or Handytech). The unit has two lightweight legs that pivot into an L-shaped arrangement from their compact carrying position. This securely supports the unit so its scanning camera can obtain a clear image of the material to be read. It also serves as a tactile guide for users to position the material to be scanned. The unit&#x27;s motion detector can scan up to 20 pages per minute in a bound book as the user turns a page, waits for the shutter sound, and turns the page again. A single keystroke can start or stop scanning or reading. Text can be saved as a text file for future editing. The unit can also describe a page layout as a sighted person sees it. The Eye-Pal reads in a male or female voice. COMPATIBILITY: For use with Windows-based PC or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Windows-based computer, Microsoft Windows XP or Windows 7 operating system; 2 gigahertz (GHz) Pentium or equivalent AMD processor; 1 gigabyte (GB) memory; 1 GB free space on hard drive; USB 2.0 port; and DVD drive for installation. For Apple Macintosh computers, OS X Version 10.5 or higher operating system; Intel processor; 1 GB memory; 2 GB free space on hard drive; USB 2.0 port; DVD drive for installation. WEIGHT: 1 pound.
