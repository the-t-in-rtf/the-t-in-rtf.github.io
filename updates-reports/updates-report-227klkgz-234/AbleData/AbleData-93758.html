Price includes cost of a Commodore 64. The keyboard contains 80 pushbutton keys, each 3/4&quot; square, hinged on the edge furthest away from the user. Keys are color coded by function. Keys are separated horizontally by small vertical dividing walls. The rows are 1&quot; apart and each is 3/8&quot; higher than the preceding one. There are two modes of operation. One requires a single key press and the other requires two presses consecutively. The second option reduces unintentional key entries. A beep sounds when a key press is accepted ( after each key press in single hit mode, after two consecutive in double hit mode). Certain keys (shift, control, etc.) are electronically latched to be controlled by pressing only one key at a time. A COMvoice speech synthesizer and VICcontroller allow speech output and environmental control (purchased separately). The EDACTS can also function as input to other computer systems, with appropriate interfaces and emulators. Contact manufacturer for details. COMPATIBILITY: For use on Commodore 64 computers. DIMENSIONS: 22.5 x 11 x 3.75 inches. WEIGHT: 8 pounds.
