To help Web designers identify potential design issues, including issues of usability as well as accessibility, this simulation tool enables designers to experience their site as a user who is blind, color blind, or has low vision might experience it. The simulator can make adjustments such as blurring or darkening the Web page&#x27;s text and images to represent certain vision impairments. The original page is displayed next to the simulated page so the designer can compare and contrast the views. The program evaluates Web page elements that may affect usability, such as color contrast, font size, alternate text for images and page links. It has a site-web analyzer to test the site for compliance with established U.S. and Japanese accessibility guidelines, reporting and explaining possible violation. The analyzer summarizes the evaluation results of gathered pages to compute the overall rating of the whole Web site and provides a graphical representation of that site&#x27;s statistics. Analysis results can be exported to text files and images, enabling smooth communication between administrators and designers. COMPATIBILITY: For use on IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 500 megaHertz (MHz) processor; 256 megabytes (MB) memory; 100 MB of available hard disk space; SVGA 800x600 or higher display; Windows 2000 or XP operating system; Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher; English and Japanese language support.
