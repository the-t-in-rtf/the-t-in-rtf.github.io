Each level includes materials for the following competencies: career decision-making, job applications, business letters, labor market information, interviewing, resumes, punctuality/attendance, positive attitude/behavior, appearance, interpersonal relationships, and completing tasks. A teacher’s guide, pre- and post-assessments, and lesson plans are provided at no extra cost. The duplicatable books are available in digital format (Word or PDF) after purchase at no additional cost. This allows the print to be enlarged and materials to be put into alternate formats.
