This application (or app) teaches a child 1,122 words. Most words can be sounded out using common phonics rules (i.e, grouped by short vowel, long vowel, Bossy R&#x27;s and other vowel team words), and others do not follow those normal rules and must be memorized. This app also uses phonics to help the user learn new words by putting sounds together to make words (e.g., /b/ /a/ /t/ makes &quot;bat&quot;). In this game, the child helps Cimo the penguin reach an iceberg to catch fish. Each correct letter chosen adds a block to Cimo&#x27;s bridge. When the word is finished, Cimo can cross, but wrong letters cause Cimo to fall in the water. This app is divided into six levels to help children practice words grouped by vowel sounds (i.e, Short Vowels, Long Vowels, Bossy R and other Vowel Teams), with one for Irregular Vowels. The final challenge level mixes all the words (that follow the basic rules of phonics) together and adds incorrect letter options to increase difficulty. This app includes a progress report for parents that tracks the child&#x27;s performance in spelling the sight and high frequency words and provides play history with game details. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.2 or later.
