This non-programmable keyboard is a one-piece unit with the keys divided into right- and left-handed concave sections or key wells. The key wells are designed to accommodate different finger lengths, shortening the reach to distant keys. Keys frequently accessed by weaker fingers such as backspace and enter have been relocated to the center under the thumbs. The numeric keypad is embedded in the right-hand key well, which reduces key travel. The keyboard also features integrated palm rests.The Contoured Classic Keyboard has all of the features of the Essential model with the addition of programmability to reduce keystrokes or customize the keyboard layout. The Contoured Professional Keyboard has all the features of the Classic model plus a single-action programmable foot switch, ClickWare software, and KeyWare software. The foot switch emulates keyboard actions from the shift key to a key sequence. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers with AT/PS2 connection. OPTIONS: Single-, dual, or three-action programmable foot switches for use with all models; ClickWare software for the Classic model; and KeyWare software for the Classic model.
