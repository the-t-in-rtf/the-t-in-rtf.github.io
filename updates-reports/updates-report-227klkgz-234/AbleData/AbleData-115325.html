It is designed to remind people to take their medications at the proper times and in the proper amounts. This application (or app) stores details of  up to five medications the user needs to take, including quantity purchased, frequency and dosage, an image of the medication, and notes on the medication. Based on this information, MedCoach sends the user reminders when it is time to take each medication. Upon receiving a reminder, the user can indicate whether he/she has taken the medicine, wants to be reminded again later, or has skipped taking the medicine this time. The user can place MedCoach&#x27;s icon in the device&#x27;s dock at the bottom of the screen so that the number of reminders pending will be displayed in a small red circle whenever the device is on. MedCoach offers a medication lookup feature that accesses the First DataBank national drug database to help select medication and dosage. It also offers access to the user&#x27;s medicine usage history and provides the means to share that history with a doctor or pharmacist. The program will connect the user to a pharmacy when a prescription needs to be refilled. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 4.2 or later.
