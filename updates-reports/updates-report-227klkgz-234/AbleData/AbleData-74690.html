This unit eliminates and/or significantly controls tremors by supporting graduated vertical, horizontal, and circular movements. The unit mounts to any table top (other than glass) or to a wheelchair. The user&#x27;s arm is placed in a trough-style arm holder and secured with straps, and the unit&#x27;s three tension adjusters are set to counter tremors. This arm support can enable the user to eat, drink, write, or brush his or her own hair. It can be used by left- or right-handed individuals of any size and for any type of tremor. It can also be used in rehabilitation for a broken arm, or a shoulder injury such as rotator cuff. The unit is lightweight, portable, and dishwasher safe. A carrying case is included. OPTIONS: Finger attachment for intentional tremors. DIMENSIONS: The height adjusts from 4 to 9 inches, and the length is 16 inches. WEIGHT: 5.5 pounds.
