The system enables the user to communicate over a phone line with synthesized speech.

Messages are converted to synthesized voice audio and sent over the phone line by way of an included audio cable and interface connector. Both sides of the conversation are heard by the caller through the included headphones. The system allows persons with speech difficulties to make and receive telephone calls privately and quietly without a third party. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Any PC capable of running a text-to-speech software program with synthesized voices; Windows based operating system; cordless or analog telephone or PBX system; and an analog telephone line. WARRANTY: Thirty-day money back guarantee.
