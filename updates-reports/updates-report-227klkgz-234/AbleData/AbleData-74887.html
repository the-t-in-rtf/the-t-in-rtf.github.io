This CD-ROM helps students prepare for community outings by teaching social considerations and step-by-step sequences for appropriate social interactions. Its realistic and detailed illustrations, instructive auditory cues, and easy to use interface give students the opportunity to rehearse skills before they go out. Activities are presented in clear and logical sequences. Social skills picture both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;not so good&quot; behaviors. The CD covers 45 activities in six categories: Shopping, transportation, eating out, important places, any place, and appointments. The activities range from basic (using restrooms) to complex (grocery shopping).  Using this program, students can master step-by-step sequences for activities such as crossing the street (find a crosswalk, push &quot;walk&quot; button, wait for &quot;walk&quot; sign, look both ways, stay in crosswalk). Other topics include: What do you say to a store clerk? Who gets off the elevator first? When do you give a hairdresser a tip? How do you request a table at a restaurant? Teachers can create a sequence of activities to reflect an actual outing, or have the student &quot;explore&quot; on their own. Teachers can also print colorful illustrations of social skills and instructional steps for classroom use or as community cues. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible and Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Macintosh version requires a PowerMac and operating system OS7.6 or later. The Windows version requires a Pentium processor or better and Windows 95 or later with a sound card. Both versions require 16-bit high-color graphics. OPTIONS: Intellikeys overlays.
