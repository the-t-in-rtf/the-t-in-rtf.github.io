It projects a computer display on a large white borad and enables one or two users to instantly and easily interact with the display&#x27;s content using their fingers or a pen as a mouse. The integrated system combines an interactive whiteboard with an ultra-short-throw projector for minimal shadows and glare. The system comes with an extended control panel (ECP) that a teacher can use  to manage all classroom technology products from the front of the classroom. It also features a SMART UX60 projector with remote control, a SMART Board interactive whiteboard, and a Modular Pen Tray. Two users can work on lesson activities at the same time anywhere on the interactive whiteboard without having to switch into a separate multiuser mode or work in a confined area. Each user can use a finger or a pen to simultaneously write, draw, perform mouse functions, erase and manipulate content with SMART Notebook collaborative learning software, or access other applications in the host computer. The system&#x27;s camera can identify when the user switches between using a finger, pen and eraser. The user can also write with a pen, erase with a palm, and move objects with a finger without having to press buttons, access on-screen menus or replace tools in the Pen Tray. COMPATIBILITY: IBM PC or compatible or Apple Macintosh computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7 or Mac OS x 10.6 Snow Leopard. DIMENSIONS: SMART Board (WxHxD): 78.5 x 51.13 x 6.5 inches; active screen area (WxH): 73.88 x 46.25 inches. SMART UX60 projector (WxHxD): 17.4 x 14.3 x 15.6 inches. Remote control (WxHxD): 1.63 x 3.38 x 0.25 inches. Extended control panel (WxHxD): 6.63 x 2.13 x 4.63 inches. WEIGHT: 60 pounds (whiteboard); 24 pounds (projector). WARRANTY: 3-year limited warranty on the projector and ECP; 1000-hour/1-year warranty on the projector lamp; 5-year limited warranty on the whiteboard.
