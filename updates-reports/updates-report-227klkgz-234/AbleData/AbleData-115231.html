This program enables an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad to function as an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) system for people who cannot speak or have difficulty speaking. The user uses photographs and preloaded vocal output to express wants and needs. The user can also record his or her own personalized audio and pair it with photos. To record audio clips on older versions of the iPod Touch, an external microphone (not included) is necessary. The program comes pre-loaded with over 80 photos distributed into 6 categories and can be customized to accommodate the user&#x27;s needs. The program can hold up to a total of 140 photos depending on the number of mega pixels of newly added photos. Picture sizes are adjustable to small, medium and large. Pre-loaded photos can be deleted to make more room for customized images. COMPATIBILITY: For use with the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Apple iOS 3.0 or later.
