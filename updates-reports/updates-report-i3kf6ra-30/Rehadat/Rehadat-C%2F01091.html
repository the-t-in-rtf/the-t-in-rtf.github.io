                                Product Type:
                                mouse button emulation
                                
                                Areas of Application:
                                - enables left- and right-click with touchscreen operation
                                - enables or facilitates mouse button operation pronounced cerebral or central movement disorders, neurological disorders or neuromuscular disabilities (ALS), spastic and flaccid paralysis when the operation of a pointing device, but not a mouse button operation of the pointing device is possible
                                - necessary as an additional program in conjunction with mouse simulators when the mouse button operation can only be done via a button or a residence
                                
                                Description:
                                Dragger is a software program for Windows, with the mouse functions as click, double click, etc. can be automatically triggered.
                                About integrated retention capabilities can perform all mouse functions. In a toolbar on the screen buttons are shown, each of the mouse buttons functions: triggering the right button, double click, holding down the right button, holding down the left button. This Toolbar can be operated in a special scanning method: when the mouse pointer rests at a position where the individual buttons sequentially scanned (scanning or Autoclick). The scanning speed can be adjusted between 0.2 and 10 seconds
