                                The Eyeblinker 2 is a system by which by means of a sensor glasses on the blink of an eye spoken sentences can be reproduced. The sensor glasses is connected to an electronics box that is connected to a notebook computer. On the computer a special software for the selection of different sentences spoken and the speech itself runs. Alternatively the sensor glasses can also use a proximity sensor.
                                In addition to the communication aid is the Eyeblinker 2, an emergency call to the maintainer possible.

                                - detection of blink via sensor goggles with infrared sensor
                                - Use of own glasses by attaching the infrared sensor possible
                                - for individuals who are able to move a hand, instead of the special glasses a hand sensor can be used
