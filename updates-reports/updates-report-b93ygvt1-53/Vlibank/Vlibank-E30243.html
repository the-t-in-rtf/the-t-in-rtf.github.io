                    Information that has been inserted since the last version appears in green.  Information removed since the last
                    version appears in red.  Insertions and deletions will be announced by most screen readers.

                            <p>Mathematics Scripture for blind, visually impaired and sighted users:<br>Thanks to Senso Math blind and partially sighted pupils can now read and write mathematical formulas in the same Word document as their sighted peers, teachers, parents, ...<br>Senso Math is an add-in for Microsoft Word 2007 and 2010 which allows instant conversion between mathematical formulas in mathematics braille, the equation editor of Word and Flemish Mathematics Code, while preserving the layout and graphics of the document.<br>Read, write and edit mathematical formulas in Microsoft Word:<br>Formulas, written in Braille, are converted automatically by Senso Math to editable graphics in the equation editor and to an editable text-based linear representation: the Flemish Mathematics Code.<br>Also in the reverse direction, the conversion happens automatically. Formulas that you delineate in Microsoft Word with the equation editor or that you deregister in linear code are perfectly readable on a braille display and editable with braille.<br>Impaired pupils who work with magnification and don't know Braille, can read formulas with the equation editor but edit very slow and difficult. In the linear mode of Senso Math this is much easier, because the formulas in Flemish Mathematics Code can be typed in the Azerty keyboard.<br>It is only the blind or visually impaired student who need to use Senso Math formulas to read and write. Seeing teachers and conversion centers can continue to use Microsoft Word the classic way and therefore keys, and create homework, exercises and textbooks on an ordinary PC without additional tools.<br>The emergence of Senso Math: to reconcile different writing forms:<br>Until now, it was for blind and partially sighted pupils not evident with mathematical formulas and to share tis in a simple and unambiguous way with sighted teachers, counselors or parents.<br>A working group of the VLOR (Flemish Education) investigated different notation systems in Europe and found that in addition to the mathematics braille there was also need for a uniform text-based code that could be written with a PC keyboard and was useful by both blind, visually impaired and sighted people. This was the trigger for the development of a new Flemish Mathematics Code.<br>That new math code was however, like the Braille code, to reconcile with the graphical mathematics quotation handled by psychics.<br>With the new software Senso Math Sensotec managed a very elegant, easy to use and extremely powerful response to this challenge.<br>Senso Math brings together the different codes in a Word document. Regardless of the form of writing which mathematical formulas are prepared, they can now be read, edited, written and exchanged by both blind, visually impaired and sighted users.<br>Benefits in the classroom:<br>The software makes the following scenarios possible:<br>The teacher can give blind students a digital copy of a text in Microsoft Word that he made with the math editor. He / she does not have to learn new things.<br>The student can read the received document to a braille display. He can choose to see mathematics Braille or text-based code.<br>A blind student who is familiar with the mathematics Braille and a Braille keyboard with his laptop, can enter Braille as before. Senso Math makes it accessible for sighted people using the equation editor, the standard math formulas installed in Microsoft.<br>The teacher can receive a document from a student and make corrections by using the equation editor.<br>A student who is not familiar with the mathematics Braille or low vision, can read and write the formulas in the text-based Flemish Mathematics Code.<br>Visually impaired or blind students, their teachers, parents and counselors use the same document to note the mathematics lessons, to study or to exam.<br>Conversion Centers only have to deliver textbooks as Word documents, where the formulas are created with the equation editor.<br>Because no conversion operations are longer required, the student and the teacher can instantly exchange documents, without wasting time, with the same efficiency as the sighted students in the classroom.<br>Technical data:<br>Senso Math does not replace a screen reader. To display text and mathematical formula on a braille display and to write with a Braille keyboard you also need a screenreading program next Senso Math.<br>For Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010.<br>Senso Math is based on the linear Flemish Mathematics Code as published in 2012 within the VLOR and the Mathematics Braille Code (Van der Mey &amp; Notaert, 1975).<br></p>
