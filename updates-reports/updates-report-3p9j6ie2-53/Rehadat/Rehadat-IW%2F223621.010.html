                                - suitable for tetraplegics, ALS patients and other disabilities, where a limited or missing manual motor control prevents the control of conventional standard equipment.
                                
                                Description:
                                Quha Zono is a computer mouse for people who depend on an alternative mouse input. The mouse movements are thereby controlled by positional changes (rotational movements) of the mouse. The computer mouse can be attached to various moving parts of the body (e.g., head, hand, back of the foot) and is wirelessly connected to the computer. Quha Zono is compatible with any operating system and can be used on different computers because all settings are stored in the device.
