                                Product Type:
                                eye control
                                
                                Areas of Application:
                                The Eyegaze System the company LC Technologies is an alternative input device that people with physical disabilities allows a computer with the eyes to control
                                
                                Features / Components:
                                - On a screen illustrated buttons can
                                be selected by sighting - several user interfaces available
                                - integrated screen keyboard
                                - integrated communication interface (with pre-sets)
                                - integrated environment control
                                - control of an additional Windows PC possible (key and pointer operation)
                                - system is fully controllable via eye including switching on and off
                                
                                a special fixed under a screen (infrared) camera reads the users movements from and observed the fixation point of the pupil on the monitor.
                                Here, the eye is illuminated by a small infrared light-emitting diode, whereby the image forming multiple reflections: on the retina to the cornea, as well as further reflections on the edges of the eyelids
                                
                                A specially developed software calculates from the reflections on the retina and the cornea continuously both the coordinates of the fixed point. as well as their duration. Longer fixing a button displayed on the screen causes a function associated with the button. The dwell time is adjustable
                                By tracking the eye movements by means of a camera system, no further means are necessary to the head or body of the user are attached
                                
                                The user must be able to meet the following requirements:

                                - the ability to keep the head in front of the Eyegaze camera resting
                                - something literacy understanding
                                
                                the room should preferably not be shining brightly illuminated to allow a better evaluation of the infrared light and the system should be installed outside light sources
                                
                                ot be shining brightly illuminated to allow a better evaluation of the infrared light and the system should be installed outside light sources
