Just place your book or document on the SARA, and press the scan button. SARA automatically recognizes the text and reads it to you. During the reading, you
                                can adjust the voice rate and volume as well as fast forward and rewind. If you want to take time to examine a document in detail, pause and use the intuitive navigational keys to read line by line or word by word. You can even spell out words to get a better understanding of what is being spoken.
